# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

# UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. - NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.

Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).

Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.

In the opinion of management:

In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.

Basis of Consolidation:

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment assessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.

# Quarterly Report

# Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19

Various governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions. These restrictions have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. COVID-19 has produced uncertainty around the world and it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.

# Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,” which requires disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2022. The additional required annual disclosures are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

# Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,” which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as if the acquiring entity had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.

# Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Non-Financial Assets

Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.

We did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.

**Summary of Non-Marketable Equity Securities**
| |December 31, 2021|March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Initial cost basis|$279 million|$281 million|
|Upward adjustments|$4 million|$4 million|
|Downward adjustments (including impairment)|$0|$0|
|Total carrying value at the end of the period|$283 million|$285 million|

Note 4 – Equity Method Investments

**Carrying Value of Equity Method Investments**
| |December 31, 2021|March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|MLU B.V.|$751 million|$574 million|
|Mission Bay 3 & 4|$38 million|$37 million|
|Other|$11 million|$13 million|
|Total equity method investments|$800 million|$624 million|

MLU B.V. Investment

We reviewed for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian economy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.

MLU B.V. Basis Difference

Included in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. on a one-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar. The Ruble depreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 15% between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022. The movement in exchange rates will be reflected in the carrying value of the investment with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2022, as we record our share of MLU B.V.’s earnings and reflect our share of MLU B.V.'s net assets on a one-quarter lag basis.

# Composition of Basis Difference

|Item|Amount ($ million)|
|---|---|
|Equity method goodwill|320|
|Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization|48|
|Deferred tax liabilities|(13)|
|Cumulative currency translation adjustments|(70)|
|Basis difference|285|

We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.1 years as of March 31, 2022. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.

# MLU B.V. Call Option

On August 30, 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during a two-year period as part of the agreement with Yandex to restructure our joint ventures in 2021. The MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise.

As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value; option term of 1.7 years; volatility of 50%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

As of March 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $12 million, including the recognition of a $181 million gain for the fair value change during the three months ended March 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of March 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value, which decreased significantly due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; option term of 1.4 years; volatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).

# 2016 and 2018 Senior Secured Term Loans Refinancing

On February 25, 2021, we entered into a refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $2.6 billion pursuant to an amendment to the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan agreement, the proceeds of which were used to repay in full all previously outstanding loans under the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan agreement and the 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan agreement. The $2.6 billion is comprised of (i) a $1.1 billion tranche with a maturity date of February 25, 2027, replacing the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan as a Refinancing Term Loan (the “2027 Refinanced Term Loan”), and (ii) a $1.5 billion tranche with a maturity date of April 4, 2025, replacing the 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan as an Incremental Term Loan (the “2025 Refinanced Term Loan”). The refinancing transaction qualified as a debt modification that did not result in an extinguishment.

# 2025 Convertible Notes

In December 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Convertible Notes”), including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2025 Convertible Notes of their option to purchase up to an additional $150 million principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.

# Quarterly Report

# Convertible Notes Information

As of March 31, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.

The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.

Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at our option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.

Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.

The fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.

# Senior Notes Information

The 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022.

Revolving Credit Arrangements

We have a revolving credit agreement initially entered in 2015 with certain lenders, which provides for $2.3 billion in credit maturing on June 13, 2023
(“Revolving Credit Facility”). On April 4, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) provide for
approximately $2.2 billion of revolving credit commitments, (ii) extend the maturity date for the commitments and loans from June 13, 2023 to April 4, 2027, (iii)
reduce the minimum liquidity covenant from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, (iv) replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based interest rate with a
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based interest rate, and (v) make certain other changes to the negative covenants under the amended revolving credit
agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries based on certain conditions. The credit
agreement contains customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, incur liens, and undergo certain fundamental changes,
as well as maintain a certain level of liquidity specified in the contractual agreement. The credit agreement also contains customary events of default. The
Revolving Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the payment of dividends. As of March 31, 2022, there was no balance outstanding on the Revolving Credit
Facility.

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we had letters of credit outstanding of $749 million and $741 million, respectively, of which the letters of credit
that reduced the available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility were $247 million and $239 million, respectively.

To determine the fair value of our investment in Grab as of March 31, 2021, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario (for example an initial public offering (“IPO”) or a special purpose acquisition company transaction), where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees’ capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences.

|Income Tax Expense/(Benefit)|$185 million|$(232) million|
|Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits|Increased by an immaterial amount|No impact on effective tax rate|

# Income Taxes

We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. The income tax expense/(benefit) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 was $185 million and $(232) million, respectively.

# Unrecognized Tax Benefits

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, with no impact on the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.

# Major Tax Jurisdictions

For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open, including the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, UK, and Australia.

# Ownership Change

In the event of an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. Based on the analysis through March 31, 2022, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.

# Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per share takes into account the effect of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests.

# Segment Information and Geographic Information

# Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Information

We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

As of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:

|Segment|Description|
|---|---|
|Mobility|Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.|
|Delivery|Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.|
|Freight|Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.|

For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 – Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.

Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.

The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):

| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Segment adjusted EBITDA:|$58|$650|
|Reconciling items:| | |
|Corporate G&A and Platform R&D(1), (2)|($417)|($482)|
|Depreciation and amortization|($212)|($254)|
|Stock-based compensation expense|($281)|($359)|
|Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements|($551)|—|
|Goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets|($57)|($13)|
|Acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses|($36)|($14)|
|Accelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets|($2)|—|
|COVID-19 response initiatives|($26)|($1)|
|Loss on lease arrangements, net|—|($7)|
|Restructuring and related charges|—|($2)|
|Loss from operations|($1,524)|($482)|

(1) Excluding stock-based compensation expense.

(2) Includes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments. Corporate G&A also includes certain shared costs such as finance, accounting, tax, human resources, information technology and legal costs. Platform R&D also includes mapping and payment technologies and support and development of the internal technology infrastructure. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change.

# Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies

# Contingencies

From time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.

We are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California State Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

# Driver Classification

California Attorney General Lawsuit

In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.

On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.

On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.

Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.

The California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate proceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a

# Financial and Legal Matters

# State Unemployment Taxes

In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised amount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, we recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.

# Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski

On October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of their respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to compete with Google’s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March 26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google’s former employees and awarding $127 million against Anthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its request for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel’s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and Google entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google on behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber’s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski. Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement. In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the trade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to perform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement, which was formally approved by the court on May 2, 2022. The approval of the settlement and confirmation of Levandowski’s bankruptcy plan is subject to appeal by May 16, 2022, by certain creditors and the taxing authorities. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain given the possibility of appeals, we recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022.

# Non-Income Tax Matters

We recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to such Drivers.

We are involved in a proceeding in the UK about our historic operating model in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that we charge Drivers prior to March 14, 2022. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected to consider the UK Supreme Court’s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers’ worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider of transportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution after exhausting HMRC’s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the UK Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment to the Tax Court (“pay-to-play”) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation and is required to remit VAT on Gross Bookings, which we are remitting under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987. As part of our ongoing discussions with HMRC we anticipate that they will review our VAT remittance as a merchant of transportation.

Our estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions, therefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.

# Quarterly Report

# Other Legal and Regulatory Matters

We have been subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain business practices, compliance with antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection laws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We are implementing recommendations to our managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. The outcomes and implications of these inquiries and investigations could be time-consuming, costly, and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

# Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. We may be obligated to indemnify parties for losses or claims suffered in connection with their activities. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with officers, directors, and certain employees. The maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions cannot be determined due to unique circumstances in each situation.

# Note 13 – Variable Interest Entities

Variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.

# Consolidated VIEs

We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. Total assets and liabilities for consolidated VIEs were $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion, and $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022.

# ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of forward-looking statements and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

# Overview

We are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of ride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to everyday problems.

# Driver Classification Developments

The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.

On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.

In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.

To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (“UK”) Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.

On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring their own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.

On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical

In the first quarter of 2022, our MAPCs were 115 million, declining 3 million, or 3%, quarter-over-quarter, but growing 17% compared to the same period in 2021. The quarter-over-quarter decline in MAPCs was related to a slower start to the first quarter of 2022 due to impacts from the Omicron variant of COVID-19, followed by consumer activity increases through the remainder of the first quarter of 2022 with the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform increasing from 111 million in January 2022 to 121 million in March 2022.

# Components of Results of Operations

We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.

During the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for mobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in exchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

For additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,” “Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition,” and “Note 2 - Revenue” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and Note 2 – Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

# Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization

Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.

We expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip volume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located data center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

# Operations and Support

Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.

# Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising costs, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.

# Research and Development

Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.

We expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs, offset by a decrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the sale of our ATG Business.

# Financial Information

# General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.

# Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.

As our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out our network infrastructure and building locations.

# Interest Expense

Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.

# Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net primarily includes various items such as interest income, foreign currency exchange gains (losses), gain on business divestiture, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, impairment of equity method investment, revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, and other miscellaneous items.

# Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Our effective tax rate will vary depending on various factors including the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.

# Equity Method Investments

Equity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

|---|---|---|---|
|Revenue (In millions)|$2,903|$6,854|136%|

Revenue increased $4.0 billion, or 136%, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 35%, or 39% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, and a $1.5 billion increase in Freight revenue resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was unfavorably impacted by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers. We also saw a $304 million increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for certain markets where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2022, we saw a $200 million increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK.

# Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Debt and Equity Securities

Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net decreased by $5.6 billion primarily due to changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities, including: a $1.9 billion unrealized loss on our Grab investment; a $1.7 billion unrealized loss on our Aurora investments; a $1.4 billion unrealized loss on our Didi investment; and a $462 million unrealized loss on our Zomato investment.

# Impairment of Equity Method Investment

Impairment of equity method investment represents a $182 million impairment loss recorded on our MLU B.V. equity method investment.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Mobility revenue increased $1.7 billion, or 195%, and Mobility adjusted EBITDA profit increased $320 million, or 107%.

Mobility revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility Gross Bookings due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. Business model changes in the UK that classify certain payments and incentives as cost of revenue also benefited Mobility revenue by $200 million. Additionally, Mobility revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers.

# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

# Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding various items such as income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.

We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. It also facilitates period-to-period comparisons by removing the effect of certain non-cash expenses and variable charges.

# COVID-19 Response Initiatives

To support those impacted by COVID-19, we have implemented initiatives such as financial assistance to Drivers, distribution of personal protective equipment, free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and charitable donations. These initiatives are recorded accordingly in our financial statements.

# Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure and should be considered supplemental. It does not replace the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges and may not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements.

# Constant Currency

We compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency growth rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period’s monthly exchange rates for our transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

# Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $5.9 billion of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $5.6 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $359 million of stock-based compensation expense and $254 million depreciation and amortization as well as a $27 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves.

Net cash used in operating activities was $611 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $122 million of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $1.7 billion gain on business divestiture and $281 million of stock-based compensation expense as well as a $412 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

# Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $135 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $62 million in purchases of property and equipment and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.

Net cash used in investing activities was $250 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $803 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $336 million in purchases of marketable securities and $216 million in purchases of a note receivable, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $696 million and $500 million in proceeds from the sale of non-marketable equity securities.

# Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $113 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $62 million of principal payments on finance leases.

Net cash used in financing activities was $226 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $194 million of principal repayment on Careem Notes.

# Other Information

As of March 31, 2022, $2.2 billion of our $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of March 31, 2022, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impact to us worldwide including our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.

# Purchase Commitments

As of March 31, 2022, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

# Critical Accounting Estimates

Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.

# Quarterly Report

# Financial Information

# Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:

# Interest Rate Risk

Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.

# Investment Risk

Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.

# Foreign Currency Risk

We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.

|Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting|We acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are reviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.|
|Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls|Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.|

|Item 1A|Risk Factors|
|Risk Factor Summary|- The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our business.
- Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.
- The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.
- To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.
- We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.
- If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.
- Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.
- Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these challenges may not be successful.
- If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.
- Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.
- We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.

# Risks Related to Our Business

# General Economic Risks

The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility

# Other Risks

- We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.
- We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.
- Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.
- We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.
- Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.
- We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.
- We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.
- We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.
- We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
- If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
- We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.
- Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.
- Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.
- We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.
- If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.
- The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.

# Operational Risks

Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.

The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.

Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions.

# Quarterly Report

# Competition Overview

Below is an overview of the competition faced by the company in its various offerings:

|Offering|Competitors|
|---|---|
|Mobility|Personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, public transportation, ridesharing companies (Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, Yandex.Taxi)|
|Delivery|DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, Amazon, restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, traditional grocers|
|Freight|C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, NEXT Trucking|

Competitors offer discounted services, incentives, consumer discounts, and promotions which may impact the company's revenue and margins.

# Contractual Restrictions and Market Expansion

The company faces contractual restrictions in competing with minority-owned affiliates in various regions until specific dates. Additionally, competition from affiliates like Didi and Yandex.Taxi is present in certain markets.

# Regulatory Approval and Acquisitions

Regulatory approval for acquisitions is crucial, and failure to obtain such approval may impact the company's expansion plans. Remedies required for approval could lead to increased competition in markets.

# Market Strategy

To remain competitive, the company has offered Driver incentives, consumer discounts, and promotions which have affected financial performance. Lowering fares and service fees has been a strategy to maintain competitiveness in certain markets.
---
#

# Quarterly Report

# Financial Performance and Market Competition

Below are excerpts from the quarterly report regarding financial performance and market competition:

Discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing models or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.

The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large stockholder), have made substantial investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.

We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. We have incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, and as of March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.

Our success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to maintain or increase our network scale and liquidity in that geographic market by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, or elect to offer them through a competitor’s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.

If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.

# Quarterly Report

# Financial and Operational Risks Disclosure

Below are excerpts from the quarterly report regarding financial and operational risks:

# Driver Conduct and Safety Risks

Qualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less extensive than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. This may lead to complaints, legal actions, and civil litigation related to Driver conduct.

# Criminal Activity and Misconduct

Drivers engaging in criminal activity or misconduct, as well as incidents of violent crime in certain regions, may impact consumer trust, brand reputation, and business operations.

# Liability and Insurance Risks

The company may face significant liability claims based on accidents or incidents caused by Drivers, consumers, or third parties. Insurance coverage may not be adequate, leading to increased operating costs and negative publicity.

# New Offerings and Technologies

Substantial investments are being made in new offerings and technologies, with risks associated with the development of nascent industries and unproven business strategies. The success of these initiatives is not guaranteed.

# Future Prospects

There is uncertainty regarding consumer demand for new initiatives, market acceptance, and potential competition from other products. Development efforts may divert resources from established products.

# Quarterly Report

# Financial and Operational Risks in International Markets

As of March 31, 2022, the company operated in approximately 72 countries, with markets outside the United States accounting for about 75% of all Trips. Operating internationally poses various risks and challenges that are different from those faced in the United States. Some of the key risks include:

- Operational and compliance challenges due to distance, language, and cultural differences
- Localization requirements such as translating the mobile app and website, adapting operations to local laws and regulations
- Stringent laws and regulations in areas like competition, pricing, payment methods, transportation services, privacy, intellectual property, etc.
- Competition from local companies with better market understanding and government favoritism
- Social acceptance variations, technological compatibility issues, and exposure to improper business practices
- Legal uncertainties regarding liability for platform users' actions, staffing challenges, and labor union issues
- Currency exchange rate fluctuations, cash transaction preferences, and payment fraud risks
- Tax complexities, financial reporting burdens, and internal control challenges
- Import/export restrictions, trade regulation changes, and political/social/economic instability

These risks can impact the company's financial results and future prospects if not managed effectively.

# Other Information

Public health concerns or emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate, could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Our ownership in minority-owned affiliates involves significant risks that are outside our control. We have limited influence over these entities, which could result in potential loss of value.

Our growth strategy includes divesting certain business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with local ridesharing and delivery companies. This strategy also involves divesting certain lines of businesses entirely and instead partnering with competitors in those lines of businesses.

# Quarterly Report

# Financial Information

|Year|Revenue Source|Percentage|
|---|---|---|
|2021|Metropolitan Areas|23%|
|2021|Airport Trips|11%|

# Challenges and Risks

The company faces challenges and risks related to maintaining brand, changes in economies, competition, and regulatory conditions. The concentration of operations in metropolitan areas and airport trips also poses risks to financial results.

# Metropolitan Areas

The company derives a significant percentage of Gross Bookings from metropolitan areas like Chicago, Miami, New York City, Sao Paulo, and London. Competition in these areas leads to offering incentives and promotions, making the business susceptible to various conditions.

# Suburban and Rural Areas

Penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas poses challenges due to smaller network, lower vehicle ownership costs, and convenience. Failure in these areas could limit the total addressable market.

# Airport Trips

Operating results are impacted by regulations affecting drivers providing trips to and from airports. Changes in travel behavior due to COVID-19 and airport-specific regulations can affect demand for airport-related Mobility.

# Autonomous Vehicle Technologies

The company's financial performance could be impacted if autonomous vehicle technologies are not offered on the platform or fail to meet expectations compared to competitors.

# Investments in Autonomous Technologies

The company has invested in partnerships for autonomous vehicle technologies, such as the merger with Aurora. Autonomous vehicles are seen as having significant potential in the industry.

# Financials and Other Information

# Autonomous Vehicle Technologies

Various companies, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox, Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies. This poses a competitive threat in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries.

# Risks and Liabilities

There are significant risks and liabilities associated with autonomous vehicle technologies, including collisions, failures, and regulatory challenges. These factors could impact the company's reputation, brand, and financial performance.

# Personnel Challenges

The company's success depends on retaining high-quality personnel. Attrition, succession planning issues, and challenges in attracting talent could adversely affect the business.

# Leadership Transitions

Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty and disrupt the business. The loss of key personnel or failure to attract and retain talent could harm operating results and growth prospects.

# Key Personnel Dependence

The company relies on key personnel, including the Chief Executive Officer. Failure to manage succession plans or key employee transitions could have adverse effects on business operations.

# Retention Strategies

The company uses equity incentives among other measures to attract and retain key personnel. However, these measures may not always be sufficient.

# Quarterly Report

# Financial and Operating Results

We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.

Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.

Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.

Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.

# Financial and Transactional Risks

We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.

To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.

We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.

As of March 31, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $234 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of March 31, 2022. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.
---
#

# Quarterly Report

# Financial Information and Risk Factors

# Interest and Principal Payments on Indebtedness

We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.

# Debt Instruments and Restrictions

In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.

# Tax Liabilities and Risks

We may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our compliance with tax rules, which could result in additional taxes owed. Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results.

# Changes in Global and U.S. Tax Legislation

We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, and modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Furthermore, beginning on January 1, 2022, the Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize these expenses. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or modified, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be adversely impacted by this legislation.

We are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our business. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could become subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental bodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, operating results, and cash flows.

# Net Operating Loss Carryforwards and Tax Attributes

As of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January 1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.

# Fluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates

Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

# Acquisition Risks

If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated. As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies.

# Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business

We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.

In certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model has been blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such jurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements or risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or legislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit.

Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us to comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire vehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In August 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruising cap,” intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City. Although such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.

In certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that we believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease operations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our business operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal challenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our financial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled that we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched Mobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in certain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and offerings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this practice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our licenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision as a gesture of

# Quarterly Report

# Financial and Regulatory Risks

Below are the details regarding the financial and regulatory risks faced by the company:

As of March 31, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. We are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted.

Further, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical transportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that limit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.9% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022.

In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest the application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform users, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related to, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product liability, discrimination, safety, and employment.

These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time-consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in financial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which could harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results.

# Financial and Regulatory Information

# Competition Laws and Business Risks

Competition authorities closely scrutinize the company under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect the business, financial condition, or operating results. The company faces risks related to pricing parity, price-fixing, abuse of market power, and potential regulatory actions.

# Government Regulation on Payment and Financial Services

The company's business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. Regulatory requirements may impact the company's operations, licensing, and growth strategies. Compliance with Strong Customer Authentication ("SCA") regulatory requirements in the EEA and other countries may affect the user experience and payment transactions on the platform.

# Financial Implications and Business Operations

The company may face challenges such as negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits due to quality problems, material defects, or non-compliance with competition laws. Governmental agencies and regulators could impose fines, penalties, restrictions, or require modifications to the company's operations, impacting costs, liabilities, and demand for the platform.

# Quarterly Report

# Financial Regulations and Investigations

Below are excerpts from the quarterly report regarding financial regulations and investigations:

Increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform.

As we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money transmission, online payments, and financial regulation.

Our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned parties.

We are currently subject to inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from various government agencies, which could harm our business.

We are the subject of DOJ criminal and civil inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by other government agencies.

Investigations and enforcement actions from government entities, as well as negative publicity, could severely disrupt our business.

In March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber BV were fined by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations.

We are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and other countries.

These government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention from us and our senior management.

If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions.

Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional reputational harm.

# Quarterly Report

# Financial and Legal Information

Below are excerpts from the quarterly report regarding financials and legal matters:

# Data Protection and Legal Compliance

Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

# Legal Proceedings and Risks

Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices.

# Arbitration Provisions

In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome.

# Legal Compliance Risks

Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

# Quarterly Report

# Financial Risk and Insurance Considerations

In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.

# Liability Concerns

We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

# Regulatory Compliance

In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.

# Pricing Regulations

Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.

# Intellectual Property Protection

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be

# General Risk Factors

As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.

The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and challenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required for a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth offerings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.

|---|---|
|Timing of RSU Election|4.2. Timing of RSU Election 4.2.1. Generally, an RSU Election must be made on or before the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year for which the RSU Election is to be effective and during which the services related to the Compensation will be performed, or at such earlier time as may be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion. 4.2.2. If an individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program (including in connection with the adoption of the Program on the Effective Date) during a calendar year, the individual may make an RSU Election for services performed in the calendar year on or before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program. The RSU Election shall be irrevocable and shall apply only to Compensation earned with respect to services performed after the later of (a) the Effective Date, (b) the date on which the RSU Election Form is received by the Administrator, or (c) such later date as specified by the Administrator in the RSU Election Form.|
|Effect of RSU Election|4.3. Effect of RSU Election. On each date that Compensation would otherwise be paid to the Participant, the portion of the Compensation subject to the RSU Election (to the extent not subject to a Deferral Election) shall be converted from cash into an RSU Award by dividing the dollar amount subject to the RSU Election by the average daily closing price per Share of the Company’s common stock in the month prior to the Conversion Date to determine the number of Shares underlying the RSU Award, with any fractional Share rounded up to the next whole Share.|
|Vesting and Issuance of RSU Award|4.4. Vesting and Issuance of RSU Award. To the extent not subject to a Deferral Election, and unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying an RSU Award shall be fully vested, and shall be issued on or as soon as administratively practicable after the Conversion Date, but in any event within 60 days following the Conversion Date.|
|RSU Award Subject to Terms of Equity Incentive Plan|4.5. RSU Award Subject to Terms of Equity Incentive Plan. RSU Awards made under this Section 4 (including, for purposes of clarification, such RSU Awards that are subject to a Deferral Election) shall be issued under the Equity Plan. As such, RSU Awards and any Award Agreements governing them are subject to the Equity Plan’s terms, including, by way of example and not limitation, the Equity Plan’s terms regard tax withholding, restrictions on awards and Shares (including clawback/recovery), and corporate events.|
|Election to Defer RSUs|5. Election to Defer RSUs 5.1. Deferral Election. A Director may elect to defer the issuance of a designated percentage of any or all of the Shares underlying an RSU Award (a “Deferral Election”), with such number of Shares rounded up to the next whole Share, by properly completing and filing a Deferral Election Form in the manner specified by the Administrator. Each Deferral Election shall become irrevocable immediately following the applicable deadline for making a Deferral Election under Section 5.2, and cannot be modified for any reason thereafter, except as provided in Section 5.4 below. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, a Deferral Election applies solely with respect to (a) Converted RSU Awards related to Compensation payable for services that are performed in the calendar year specified in the Deferral Election Form and does not apply with respect to Converted RSU Awards related to Compensation|

|Section|Details|
|---|---|
|5.2. Timing of Deferral Election|5.2.1. With respect to a Converted RSU Award, a Director must make a Deferral Election with respect to Compensation payable for services performed in a calendar year at the same time that an RSU Election for this Compensation may be made pursuant to Section 4.2. 5.2.2. With respect to a Non-Converted RSU Award, generally, a Deferral Election must be made on or before the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year in which the Non-Converted RSU Award is to be issued to the Director. If an individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program (including in connection with the adoption of the Program on the Effective Date) during a calendar year, the individual may make a Deferral Election with respect to the Non-Converted RSU Award on or before the date that is 30 days after the later of (a) the Effective Date, or (b) the date on which the individual first becomes eligible to participate in the Program. The Deferral Election shall be irrevocable and shall apply only to the portion of the Non-Converted RSU Award earned with respect to services performed on or after the date on which the Deferral Election Form is received by the Administrator.|
|5.3. Form of Issuance|Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, a Participant may, in the Deferral Election Form, designate that the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs will be issued in either (i) a single payment or (ii) three annual installments over three years. A Participant may designate a different form of issuance with respect to each RSU Award for which the Participant makes a Deferral Election. If and to the extent that a Participant does not designate the form of issuance in the Deferral Election Form, the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs pursuant to that Deferral Election Form shall be issued as a single payment.|
|5.4. Re-deferral Election|In the Administrator’s sole discretion, a Participant may elect to postpone the date of issuance of the Deferred RSUs under Section 6.2 by making an election in the form and manner specified by the Administrator (“Re-deferral Election”). A Re-deferral Election is permissible only if it defers issuance of the underlying Shares for at least five years from the year of the originally scheduled issuance date, does not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the Re-deferral Election is made, and otherwise complies with Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-2(b) or its successor. In the event of a Corporate Transaction or the Participant’s Disability or death, however, the underlying Shares shall be issued pursuant to Section 6.3, without regard to any Re-deferral Elections.|
|6. Issuance of Shares under Deferred RSUs|6.1. Issuance Upon Termination of Service. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying a Participant’s Deferred RSUs shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) in the form designated by the Participant as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant’s termination of service, but in any case within 90 days following the date of termination of service. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether a Participant has terminated from service and the effective date of such termination.|

|Section|Description|
|---|---|
|6.2|In-Service Distribution. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement and notwithstanding Section 6.1, a Participant may elect on the Participant’s Deferral Election Form that the Shares underlying the Deferred RSUs shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) in the form designated by the Participant on or as soon as administratively practicable after the in-service distribution date designated by the Participant in the Deferral Election Form; provided, however, that such date is after the third anniversary of the date of the Deferral Election Form, and that if the Participant’s service with the Company terminates for any reason prior to the in-service distribution date, the Shares shall be issued (with respect to a single payment) or begin to be issued (with respect to annual installments) on or about the May 16 following the termination of service (or such other date as may be specified by the Administrator in accordance with Section 409A of the Code).|
|6.3|Annual Installments. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, after the initial installment of Shares is issued, all subsequent installment of Shares shall be issued in each subsequent calendar year on the anniversary of the date upon which the initial installment of Shares was issued under Section 6.1. Each annual installment shall be calculated by dividing the number of Shares covered by the Deferred RSUs divided by three; provided, however, that if the foregoing would produce fractional Shares, the number of Shares covered under an RSU Award shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share and the fractional Share will be accumulated so that the resulting whole Share(s) will be included in the number of Shares covered by the final installment.|
|6.4|Accelerated Issuance Upon Corporate Transaction, Disability, or Death. Notwithstanding Sections 6.1 and 6.2, and unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction or the Participant’s Disability or death, the Shares underlying all Deferred RSUs shall be issued in a single payment to the Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary under Section 6.5, as applicable) as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable event, but in case within 90 days following the applicable event.|
|6.5|Beneficiary. A Participant may designate a beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary in the form and manner specified by the Administrator. Any beneficiary designation hereunder shall remain effective until properly changed or revoked. A beneficiary designation may be changed by the Participant at any time before the Participant’s death by filing a new designation in writing with the Administrator. If the Participant dies without having designated a beneficiary in accordance with this Section 6.5 or if the Participant dies and the beneficiary so designated by the Participant has predeceased the Participant or otherwise ceased to exist, then the Participant’s estate shall be deemed to be the beneficiary.|
|6.6|Vesting and Issuance of Shares. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator in an Award Agreement, the Shares underlying RSU Awards representing Deferred RSUs shall be fully vested, and shall be issued on or as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable issuance date under this Section 6, but no later than March 15th of the calendar year following the calendar year containing the applicable issuance date (or, in the case of death, no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died).|

# 8.3 Amendment, Suspension, and Termination

The Compensation Committee of the Board has the right by written resolution to amend, suspend, or terminate the Program at any time, subject to the terms of this Section 8.3. After a Corporate Transaction, no amendment, suspension, or termination that reduces the benefits to which a Participant is entitled under the Program will apply to a Director who, at the time the amendment is adopted, already is a Participant without his or her express written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee of the Board may amend the Program at any time to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, provided that, to the extent possible, such amendment does not reduce the benefits of a Participant.

# 8.4 Power to Delegate Authority

The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, delegate to any person or persons all or part of its authority and responsibility under the Program.

# 8.5 Headings

The headings used in this document are for convenience of reference only and may not be given any weight in interpreting any provision of the Program.

# 8.6 Severability

If an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction determines that any term, provision, or portion of the Program is void, illegal, or unenforceable, the other terms, provisions, and portions of the Program will remain in full force and effect, and the terms, provisions, and portions that are determined to be void, illegal, or unenforceable will either be limited so that they will remain in effect to the extent permissible by law, or such arbitrator or court will substitute, to the extent enforceable, provisions similar thereto or other provisions, so as to provide to the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefits intended by the Program.

# 8.7 Governing Law

The Program will be construed, administered, and regulated in accordance with the laws of California (excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle), except to the extent that those laws are preempted by federal law.

# 8.8 Complete Statement of Program

The Program contains a complete statement of its terms. A Participant’s right to any benefit of a type provided under the Program will be determined solely in accordance with the terms of the Program. No other evidence, whether written or oral, will be taken into account in interpreting the provisions of the Program. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 8.8, for purposes of determining the RSU Award due to a Participant, the Program will be deemed to include the applicable terms of the Equity Plan and any applicable Award Agreement.

# 8.9 Compliance with Section 409A of the Code

The Program will be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Program and the benefits hereunder exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent Section 409A of the Code is applicable, (a) distributions shall only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted under Section 409A of the Code, (b) payments to be made upon a termination of service shall only be made upon a “separation from service” under Section 409A of the Code, (c) each installment payment shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and (d) in no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year in which a distribution is made except in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. In no event will any Participant have a right to payment or reimbursement or otherwise from the Company or its Affiliates.
