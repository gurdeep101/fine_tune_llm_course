Barely had the pandemic receded,and the war in Ukraine broke out in February 2022. Prices of food, fuel and fertiliser rose sharply. As inflation ratesaccelerated, central banks of advanced countries scrambled to respond with monetary policy tightening. Manydeveloping countries, particularly in the South Asian region, faced severe economic stress as the combination ofweaker currencies, higher import prices, the rising cost of living and a stronger dollar, making debt servicing moreexpensive, proved too much to handle.In the second half of 2022, there was a respite for governments and households. Commodity prices peakedand then declined. In the near term, the acute pressure was relieved, although prices of some commodities (e.g.,crude oil) remain well above their pre-pandemic levels. For countries dependent on imports, priced and payable indollars, a global slowdown led by the United States (US) offers a triple relief. Commodity prices decline, and USinterest rates peak, as does the US dollar. Capital and current account imbalances abate.As 2023 rolled in, China opened up rather swiftly, reversing its Zero-Covid policy. An unexpectedly warm winterthat has spared households from a debilitating increase in fuel prices that would have dented their disposable incomesignificantly has stirred hopes that the Eurozone economies would narrowly avoid a recession. As the headline inflationrate declines in the US, policy rates are set to rise more slowly. In anticipation, bond yields have come down, and thereare faint hopes of the US avoiding a recession altogether, barring any unexpected financial system stress .Lower chances of a downturn in advanced economies and resumption of economic activity bring with them hopesfor some developing economies that are export-dependent and concerns for those who are heavily import-dependentfor essential commodities. In anticipation of higher-than-earlier forecasted demand, crude oil prices have begun toclimb, as have the prices of industrial metals. Wage negotiations are leading to upward revisions on either side of theAtlantic. Meaningful interest rate reductions in the US and the Eurozone may not materialise as quickly as one wouldhave hoped. The year promises to be far from predictable and may hold surprises for countries and households.For India, 2022 was special. It marked the 75th year of India’s Independence. India became the world’s fifth-largest economy, measured in current dollars. Come March, the nominal GDP of India will be around US$ 3.5trillion. In real terms, the economy is expected to grow at 7 per cent for the year ending March 2023. This followsan 8.7 per cent growth in the previous financial year. The rise in consumer prices has slowed considerably. Theannual rate of inflation is below 6 per cent. Wholesale prices are rising at a rate below 5 per cent. The export ofgoods and services in the first nine months of the financial year (April – December) is up 16 per cent compared tothe same period in 2021-22. Although the high oil price this year compared to last inflated India’s import bill andcaused the merchandise trade deficit to balloon, concerns over the current account deficit and its financing haveebbed as the year rolled on. Foreign exchange reserve levels are comfortable and external debt is low.India had a good monsoon, and reservoir levels are higher than last year and the 10-year average. Thefundamentals of the Indian economy are sound as it enters its Amrit Kaal, the 25-year journey towards its centenaryas a modern, independent nation. Policies pursued carefully and consciously have ensured that the recovery isrobust and sustainable. This is the context in which the Economic Survey undertakes an assessment of the economyin the present, in the light of the recent past and examines its prospects in the coming years. Before I give you anoverview of what awaits inside the pages of the Economic Survey of 2022-23, it is worth reiterating that the yearis still ongoing, and the survey is based on nine months of data at best or eight mostly.As per convention, the first chapter examines the state of the economy and how it has come through yet anotheryear of twists and turns in the worlds of economics and politics. As the impact of the pandemic recedes – Japanis about to downgrade it into seasonal flu, and Denmark might have done so already - Chapter 2 analyses India’smedium-term economic outlook and concludes that it looks bright. It is an analysis of the financial cycles and therole it plays in influencing economic growth over the medium term. India’s financial cycle endured a downturn lastdecade because credit expansion in the millennium’s first decade ultimately proved unsustainable. The financialvii history of the world suggests that the outcome was unsurprising. The rapid expansion of credit, fuelled by copiouscapital flow, has invariably foretold a financial crisis. India was no exception. The chapter tells the story of howthe government navigated the economy through a period of financial stress wherein corporate, banking and non-banking balance sheets were repaired and restored to health. Not letting the crisis go waste (i.e., fashioning aneffective policy response to the crisis and beyond), the government ramped up public investment in infrastructureto prepare the ground for the private sector to invest, hire and prosper. It records the wide-ranging structural reformsand governance improvements that the government has undertaken since 2014.While reforms before 2014 addressed product and capital markets, reforms since then have emphasisedenhancing the ease of living and doing business to improve economic efficiency. The key principles on which thesepolicies have been anchored are creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, partnering with the privatesector for development and improving agricultural productivity. With cleaner, leaner and stronger balance sheetsand payoffs flowing from reforms, India’s potential growth stands elevated, and the ability of the economy to growat its potential is enhanced. Without making extravagant claims, the chapter concludes with optimism about India’smedium-term outlook.Chapter 3 focuses on India’s fiscal policy trajectory and examines the evolution of the Goods and Services Taxas a source of durable and dependable revenue for states and the centre. Given India’s demographic advantage andannual nominal GDP growth potential to be around 10 per cent to 12 per cent on average in the coming years, fiscalparameters will continue to improve. It is said that growth drives the fiscal balance in India, and it is true. At thesame time, it is possible to imagine fiscal discipline turning into fiscal stimulus in future, as it would bring downthe government’s cost of borrowing, lowering the present high share of interest payments in public expenditure andmaking more money available for economic development and social welfare.Money, Banking and Capital Markets are the subjects of Chapter 4. During the year, the Reserve Bank of India(RBI) raised interest rates swiftly to prevent the second-round effects of the inflation shock from commoditiesfrom affecting economic activity. That played a big part in the relative stability of the Indian rupee against the USdollar in a year of dollar strength. That India’s import cover and external debt ratios are not matters of concernis largely due to India’s long-standing conservative external borrowing policies and RBI’s deft management offoreign exchange reserves. India’s capital markets have been a historical success story. International benchmarkindices of Indian stocks have outperformed their emerging market and global peers over the long haul. In short,Indian stocks have rewarded investors well over the years. Foreign portfolio investors have significantly benefitedfrom that. The last two years have also seen a rise in the participation of Indian domestic retail investors in bignumbers in Indian stocks. Not only did their investments cushion the impact of portfolio outflows that occur fromtime to time, but they also added to their wealth stock, given the performance of Indian stocks in 2021 and 2022.The following chapter on prices is a story of the convergence of India’s wholesale and retail prices throughoutthe year. India’s wholesale price inflation leapt to 16.6 per cent in May 2022, and the gap between wholesale priceinflation and consumer price inflation widened. When the wholesale price inflation is high, there is always a riskthat it will pass through to retail prices. The gap or the wedge between the two closed by the end of the year asglobal commodity prices retreated and the government took proactive measures to rein in their domestic prices.In a departure from the past, we introduce the chapter on India’s social sector (Chapter 6) next, followedby the chapter on climate change and environment (Chapter 7) and not without reason. Social welfare is not anafterthought for the government but its leitmotif. The comprehensive and ‘leave no one behind’ approach that thegovernment has adopted for social welfare gets full treatment in this chapter. The chapter highlights how the useof technology has enhanced the quality of life for citizens to ensure the reach of social sector schemes to intendedbeneficiaries, especially during the pandemic. The transformations in the lives of the citizens happening through theAspirational Districts Programme, Direct Benefit Transfers, use of Aadhaar and various initiatives in the education,health and basic infrastructure availability are highlights of the chapter. The thirteen boxes that the chapter features– an unusually large number - are an acknowledgement of the myriad innovations in social welfare schemes and intheir delivery that the government has embraced and implemented.viii Climate change and the environment are not only hot-button issues globally but are critical to India realisingits aspirations. Hence, India currently spearheads one of the most robust climate actions through its NationallyDetermined Contributions (NDC), which includes an ambitious programme for transitions to clean energy in theworld. Despite the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on the economy, the country has enhanced its climate ambitionmanifold.The health of the farm sector is critical for the economic and social well-being of the country. India has achieveddomestic food security and has become a net exporter of farm output to the world. The potential is larger. Chapter8 documents India’s transition from food security to nutritional security and the importance that the governmentaccords agricultural productivity.Chapters 9 to 12 are bread-and-butter features of the Economic Survey. They deal with Industry, Services, theExternal Sector and Infrastructure in that order. Indian industry, as mentioned earlier, is on the cusp of a growthrevival facilitated by public investment and policies that have eased business conditions and improved viability.Bank credit to industry has picked up momentum, particularly for micro, small and medium enterprises. Amongother things, the pandemic had caused a shift in the attitude towards supply chains from efficiency to security andfrom ‘just in time’ to ‘just in case’. Supply chains are being recon ction-Linked-Incentive Scheme demonstrates itsdetermination to plug India into global supply chains. It is an industrial policy with a global vision. India now hasthe physical and digital infrastructure to raise the share of the manufacturing sector in the economy and make arealistic bid to be an important player in global supply chains. In the last eight years, the government has createdjust the platform for this ambition to be fulfilled. The prognosis, I dare say, is bright.India’s services sector is a source of strength and is poised to gain more. India is large enough to accommodateand nurture vibrant manufacturing and services sectors. From low to high value-added activities with exportpotential, the sector has enough scope to generate employment and foreign exchange and contribute to India’sexternal stability.As a country with a large merchandise trade deficit because of its dependence on imported fuel, the externalsector is always watched closely, especially during rising oil prices. This financial year is one such year. Variousarms of the government ensured that, in a year of extreme supply uncertainty and price volatility, India’s energysecurity was not compromised. A slowdown in global growth has led to slower export growth, but the combinedvalue of goods and services exports in current dollars for April – December 2022 is 16 per cent higher than in April–December 2021. India’s foreign direct investment has been steady, and investors’ interest in including India intheir supply chain diversification is now noticeably higher. PM Gati Shakti and the National Logistics Policy areexpected to play big roles in improving India’s cost and export competitiveness in the years ahead.That brings us to the twelfth and last chapter of the survey. It is on infrastructure. ‘Last but not least’ is clichéd,but in this case, it is a truthful cliché. We have kept one of India’s best success stories of recent years for the last.In 2019, the Government of India adopted a forward-looking programmatic approach towards infrastructure. TheNational Infrastructure Pipeline was born with a projected investment of around ₹111 lakh crore for FY20-25 fordeveloping a comprehensive view of infrastructure development in the country. Roads, railways, and waterwayshave seen unprecedented expansion in the last eight years, and ports & airports have been substantially upgraded.Extending infrastructural facilities is only part of the story; modernisation is the other important objective that hasbeen pursued with verve and achieved with commendable speed.Finally, the growth and evolution of India’s public digital infrastructure is a story not just of numbers andmilestones but also of thoughtful regulatory and innovation architecture that have enabled it to retain its publicgood character with enough incentives for the private sector to innovate and invest. The untapped potential is huge,and the country needs to continue to innovate. With digital technology and infrastructure, one has to keep runningto hold onto one’s place.The international political and economic order that emerged at the end of World War II has developed faultlinesix lately, as they inevitably do if history were any guide. Consequently, envisaged as platforms for building globalconsensus, multilateral forums across the board face existential challenges today and need help to deliver on theirmandates. India, with its peaceful and democratic emergence, can influence the course of events and, in the process,fulfil its aspiration to be a global power of relevance. It is befitting that during India’s Amrit Kaal, it assumed thePresidency of G-20 nations in December 2022. Global problems need global solutions, and global solutions requirecollaboration and cooperation. Based on the theme of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: One Earth, One Family, OneFuture”, India’s G20 Presidency aims to achieve co-ordinated solutions to key issues of global concern. These issuesinclude strengthening multilateral development banks for addressing shared global challenges of the 21st century,mobilising timely and adequate climate finance, enhancing financing for pandemic preparedness, managing globalmacroeconomic vulnerabilities such as debt, global food & energy insecurity and financing urban infrastructure.The Presidency is a platform for India to share its success stories with the global community, especially the mannerin which Digital Public Infrastructure has supported an inclusive people-centric growth paradigm. In short, the G20Presidency is an opportunity for India to bind an otherwise fragmented global order.Putting the Economic Survey in the public domain is a learning experience. It is an exercise in cogent thinking,formulation of ideas and their effective articulation. It is, forever, a work in progress, just like the economy. Whilethe Survey is an annual exercise, the set of officers who put this document together is never constant, and thisenriches the publication every year. While old hands bring with them experience and expertise, newer entrantsto the division, such as Yours Truly, bring different perspectives. I am thankful to each of them for bringing theirinsights, subject expertise and experience into this year’s Survey. I also thank the officers of various ministries,departments, regulators and subject experts, who provided timely inputs and enhanced this publication. I would liketo thank the editorial team for their sincere efforts in preparing the draft.Placing all economic activities of the country under one umbrella and refining it from the economists’ lens to ageneralist’s perspective is a daunting, if worthwhile, exercise. This has been a fulfilling and worthwhile experiencebecause it has reinforced my hope and optimism for the country and its people. I hope that the data and analysis ofthe Survey will help economists, academicians, policymakers and practitioners in their pursuits.Above all, I hope it inspires the readers to partake in shaping the future of this great nation, which promises tobe every bit as glorious as its past, if not better.V.

369xlii 01State of the economy2022-23: RecoveRyCHAPTERcompleteIn general, global economic shocks in the past were severe but spaced out in time. Thischanged in the third decade of this millennium. At least three shocks have hit the globaleconomy since 2020. It all started with the pandemic-induced contraction of the globaloutput, followed by the Russian-Ukraine conflict leading to a worldwide surge in inflation.Then, the central banks across economies led by the Federal Reserve responded withsynchronised policy rate hikes to curb inflation. The rate hike by the US Fed drove capitalinto the US markets causing the US Dollar to appreciate against most currencies. This ledto the widening of the Current Account Deficits (CAD) and increased inflationary pressuresin net importing economies. The rate hike and persistent inflation also led to a lowering ofthe global growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by the IMF in its October 2022 update ofthe World Economic Outlook. The frailties of the Chinese economy further contributed toweakening the growth forecasts. Slowing global growth apart from monetary tighteningmay also lead to a financial contagion emanating from the advanced economies where thedebt of the non-financial sector has risen the most since the global financial crisis. Withinflation persisting in the advanced economies and the central banks hinting at furtherrate hikes, downside risks to the global economic outlook appear elevated.The Indian economy, however, appears to have moved on after its encounter with thepandemic, staging a full recovery in FY22 ahead of many nations and positioning itself toascend to the pre-pandemic growth path in FY23. Yet in the current year, India has alsofaced the challenge of reining in inflation that the European strife accentuated. Measurestaken by the government and RBI, along with the easing of global commodity prices, havefinally managed to bring retail inflation below the RBI upper tolerance target in November2022. However, the challenge of the depreciating rupee, although better performing thanmost other currencies, persists with the likelihood of further increases in policy rates bythe US Fed. The widening of the CAD may also continue as global commodity pricesremain elevated and the growth momentum of the Indian economy remains strong. Theloss of export stimulus is further possible as the slowing world growth and trade shrinksthe global market size in the second half of the current year.Despite these, agencies worldwide continue to project India as the fastest-growing majoreconomy at 6.5-7.0 per cent in FY23. These optimistic growth forecasts stem in partfrom the resilience of the Indian economy seen in the rebound of private consumptionseamlessly replacing the export stimuli as the leading driver of growth. The uptick inprivate consumption has also given a boost to production activity resulting in an increasein capacity utilisation across sectors. The rebound in consumption was engineered by thenear-universal vaccination coverage overseen by the government that brought people 2 Economic Survey 2022-23back to the streets to spend on contact-based services, such as restaurants, hotels,shopping malls, and cinemas, among others. The world’s second-largest vaccinationdrive involving more than 2 billion doses also served to lift consumer sentiments that mayprolong the rebound in consumption. Vaccinations have facilitated the return of migrantworkers to cities to work in construction sites as the rebound in consumption spilled overinto the housing market. This is evident in the housing market witnessing a significantdecline in inventory overhang to 33 months in Q3 of FY23 from 42 months last year.The Capital Expenditure (Capex) of the central government, which increased by 63.4 percent in the first eight months of FY23, was another growth driver of the Indian economyin the current year, crowding in the private Capex since the January-March quarter of2022. On current trend, it appears that the full year’s capital expenditure budget will bemet. A sustained increase in private Capex is also imminent with the strengthening of thebalance sheets of the Corporates and the consequent increase in credit financing it hasbeen able to generate. A much-improved financial health of well-capitalised public sectorbanks has positioned them better to increase the credit supply. Consequently, the creditgrowth to the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector has been remarkablyhigh, over 30.6 per cent, on average during Jan-Nov 2022, supported by the extendedEmergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) of the Union government. Theincrease in the overall bank credit has also been influenced by the shift in borrower’sfunding choices from volatile bond markets, where yields have increased, and externalcommercial borrowings, where interest and hedging costs have increased, towards banks.If inflation declines in FY24 and if real cost of credit does not rise, then credit growth islikely to be brisk in FY24.India’s economic growth in FY23 has been principally led by private consumption andcapital formation. It has helped generate employment as seen in the declining urbanunemployment rate and in the faster net registration in Employee Provident Fund. Still,private capex soon needs to take up the leadership role to put job creation on a fasttrack. Recovery of MSMEs is proceeding apace, as is evident in the amounts of Goodsand Services Tax (GST) they pay, while the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme(ECGLS) is easing their debt servicing concerns. The Mahatma Gandhi National RuralEmployment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been directly providing jobs in ruralareas and indirectly creating opportunities for rural households to diversify their sourcesof income generation. Schemes like PM-Kisan and PM Garib Kalyan Yojana have helpedin ensuring food security in the country, and their impact was also endorsed by theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)1. The results of the National FamilyHealth Survey (NFHS) also show improvement in rural welfare indicators from FY16to FY20, covering aspects like gender, fertility rate, household amenities, and womenempowerment.Global growth has been projected to decline in 2023 and is expected to remain generallysubdued in the following years as well. The slowing demand will likely push down globalcommodity prices and improve India’s CAD in FY24. However, a downside risk to theCurrent Account Balance stems from a swift recovery driven mainly by domestic demand1 h ttps://www.undp.org/publications/addressing-cost-living-crisis-developing-countries-poverty-and-vulnerability-projections-and-policy-responses State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 3and, to a lesser extent, by exports. The CAD needs to be closely monitored as the growthmomentum of the current year spills over into the next. Growth is expected to be brisk inFY24 as a vigorous credit disbursal, and capital investment cycle is expected to unfold inIndia with the strengthening of the balance sheets of the corporate and banking sectors.Further support to economic growth will come from the expansion of public digitalplatforms and path-breaking measures such as PM GatiShakti, the National LogisticsPolicy, and the Production-Linked Incentive schemes to boost manufacturing output.the global economy battles through a unique set of challenges1.1 In the last century, several events can be recollected that have had an adverse impact on theglobal economy. The two world wars are still vivid in public memory, along with the Spanish fluand the great depression. Regional conflicts have been several, as also intermittent oil shocks.The previous millennium closed with the East Asian crisis, and the new millennium in its firstdecade opened with the technology bust, followed several years later by the global financialcrisis. The second decade, apart from minor episodes of the taper tantrum and growing tradetensions between the super-powers, had gone relatively incident-free globally, although Europehad its moments of stress during the decade. Before the third decade of the new millenniumcommenced, incidents of global economic turbulence were generally spaced out, allowingeconomies breathing time to recover before preparing for the next challenge.1.2 The Covid-19 pandemic (‘pandemic’ hereinafter) notified by the WHO in January 2020was the first challenge of the third decade that hit global growth. Two years later, as the globaleconomy was recovering from the pandemic-induced output contraction, the Russia-Ukraineconflict broke out in February 2022, triggering a swing in commodity prices and, thus, acceleratingexisting inflationary pressures. This posed the second challenge. Soon after, the third challengeemerged when nations undertook monetary tightening to rein in inflation causing growth toweaken. Monetary tightening also drove capital flows to safe-haven US markets, contributedto rising sovereign bond yields, and depreciation of most currencies against the US dollar. Theconsequent increase in borrowing costs also stressed high levels of public and private debt,threatening the financial system. Faced with the prospects of global stagflation, nations, feelingcompelled to protect their respective economic space, slowed cross-border trade, which posedthe fourth challenge to growth. All along, the fifth challenge was festering as China experienceda considerable slowdown induced by its policies. The sixth medium-term challenge to growthwas seen in the scarring from the pandemic brought in by the loss of education and income-earning opportunities. A simultaneous occurrence of several challenges to growth is perhapsunprecedented. Like the rest of the world, India, too, faced this extraordinary set of challengesbut withstood them better than most economies.1.3 Global economic recovery was well on track until the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke outin February 2022. The conflict has now continued for almost a year, disrupting the restorationof the supply chains disrupted earlier by lockdowns and limited trade traffic. In the last elevenmonths, the world economy has faced almost as many disruptions as caused by the pandemic 4 Economic Survey 2022-23in two years. The conflict caused the prices of critical commodities such as crude oil, naturalgas, fertilisers, and wheat to soar. This strengthened the inflationary pressures that the globaleconomic recovery had triggered, backed by massive fiscal stimuli and ultra-accommodativemonetary policies undertaken to limit the output contraction in 2020. Inflation in AdvancedEconomies (AEs), which accounted for most of the global fiscal expansion and monetary easing,breached historical highs. Rising commodity prices also led to higher inflation in the EmergingMarket Economies (EMEs), which otherwise were in the lower inflation zone by virtue of theirgovernments undertaking a calibrated fiscal stimulus to address output contraction in 2020. lict levels400 10008003006002004001002000 0xednI91-rpA 91-nuJ 91-guA 91-tcO 91-ceD 02-beF 02-rpA 02-nuJ 02-guA 02-tcO 02-ceD 12-beF 12-rpA 12-nuJ 12-guA 12-tcO 12-ceD 22-beF 22-rpA 22-nuJ 22-guA 22-tcO 22-ceDxednIAll Commodity Base Metals Crude OilFood Price Fertiliser Natural Gas Price (RHS)Coal Price (RHS)Source: IMFInflation stays high, driven by high food and energy prices  12-guA 12-tcO 12-ceD 22-beF 22-rpA 22-nuJ 22-guA 22-tcO 22-ceDEuro Area France GermanyUK US Japan20151050-5tnecreP12-beF 12-rpA 12-nuJ 12-guA 12-tcO 12-ceD 22-beF 22-rpA 22-nuJ 22-guA 22-tcO 22-ceDBrazil China IndiaIndonesia Mexico RussiaSource: Bloomberg State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 51.4 Central banks, which were slow to react to price pressures building up during the nascentrecovery from the pandemic, regarded them as transient only to realise, belatedly, the necessityand the inevitability of a strong monetary policy response. Led by the US Federal Reserve, centralbanks have been hiking policy rates and rolling back liquidity to rein in inflation synchronously.The pace of this tightening cycle has been rapid – the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate hikes isthe quickest since the inflationary episode of the 1970s, with the central bank having raisedinterest rates by 425 basis points since March 2022. As the impact of monetary policy actionsis felt with a lag, inflation rates remained stubbornly high during the early phase of the rate hikecycle but have begun to decline lately. At the same time, synchronised rate hikes by the centralbanks have not tightened financial conditions sufficiently enough for central banks to end theirtightening campaign.financial conditions tighten 12-nuJ 12-ceD 22-nuJ 22-ceDUS Japan10210098969491-ceD 02-nuJ 02-ceD 12-nuJ 12-ceD 22-nuJ 22-ceDEuro Area UK 102100989694929091-ceD 02-nuJ 02-ceD 12-nuJ 12-ceD 22-nuJ 22-ceDBrazil Mexico1041021009896949291-ceD 02-nuJ 02-ceD 12-nuJ 12-ceD 22-nuJ 22-ceDIndonesia IndiaSource: Goldman Sachs, BloombergNote: All Y-axes are indices; Data is retrieved from Goldman Sachs financial condition index1.5 Inflation and monetary tightening led to a hardening of bond yields across economies andresulted in an outflow of equity capital from most of the economies around the world into thetraditionally safe-haven market of the US. Unlike the past when the capital flight was more out ofthe EMEs given their relatively greater vulnerabilities, or the perception thereof, this time around,capital has also flown out from the advanced economies. The capital flight subsequently led tothe strengthening of the US Dollar against other currencies – the US Dollar index strengthenedby 16.1 per cent between January and September 2022. The consequent depreciation of othercurrencies has been widening the CAD and increasing inflationary pressures in the net importingeconomies. 6 Economic Survey 2022-23hardening of bond yields across economies 2-nuJ 12-guA 12-tcO 12-ceD 22-beF 22-rpA 22-nuJ 22-guA 22-tcO 22-ceDEuro Area France GermanyUK US Japan141062tnecreP12-beF 12-rpA 12-nuJ 12-guA 12-tcO 12-ceD 22-beF 22-rpA 22-nuJ 22-guA 22-tcO 22-ceDBrazil China IndiaIndonesia Mexico RussiaSource: Bloomberg pital flight from emes and aes543210tnecreP02-naJ 02-nuJ 02-voN 12-rpA 12-peS 22-beF 22-luJ 22-ceDEffective Federal Funds Rate FPI Equity Flows (Jan-Dec 2022)BrazilIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaS.

The global PMI composite index has been in the contractionary zonesince August 2022, while the yearly growth rates of global trade, retail sales, and industrialproduction have significantly declined in the second half of 2022. The consequent dampeningof the global economic outlook, also compounded by expectations of a further increase inborrowing costs, was reflected in the lowering of growth forecasts by the IMF in its October2022 update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO).

Non-financial sector debt of most economies has increasedconsiderably as a percentage of GDP since Q1 of 2008 when the global financial crisis struck.India is, however, one of the few countries whose debt burden has declined over this period,mainly because of the country’s banking sector balance sheet clean-up and the corporatesector’s deleveraging exercise undertaken during the last decade. Yet, an increase in the generalgovernment debt burden in India has attracted much attention, even as systemic risks of afinancial breakdown are concentrated in other parts of the world.table I.2: core Debt of most major economies except India is higher as compared to 2008core debt of the non-financial sector change since Q2 2008(Q2 2022, % of GDp)Debt/GDp household pvt non- Government total household pvt non- Government total(avg %) financial financialGlobal avg 62 160 88 248 -4 15 27 38australia 117 181 52 232 7 -9 42 33Brazil 35 88 91 179 17 -36 28 66mainland 62 220 74 295 43 107 47 155chinafrance 67 231 114 345 19 71 47 118Germany 56 128 67 195 -4 0.4 2 3India 36 88 82 170 -7 -17 16 -7Italy 43 113 151 264 4 -4 47 43Japan 69 187 238 426 9 29 94 122South 106 222 45 268 35 61 23 84Koreamexico 16 40 41 81 3 12 20 33South 35 67 71 138 -9 -13 45 32africa State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 9Spain 57 155 118 273 -26 -56 82 26UK 84 150 107 257 -11 -28 62 34US 76 155 108 264 -22 -15 48 33Source: BIS (based on information from their 5th December 2022 update of ‘Credit to the non-financial sector’)1.9 In the developed world, inflationary pressures are abating but they are still on the higherside historically and relative to the inflation targets that many countries have adopted. Majorcentral banks have reduced the pace of interest rate hikes in their latest rounds of monetarypolicy reviews to assess the impact thus far. Still, they have reiterated that terminal policy rateswill be significantly higher than market expectations. Strong employment data and sharply lowerheadline inflation for December have raised hopes of the US economy achieving a softer landing.Similarly, in Europe, warmer winter weather has neutralised the risk of a near-term energy crisis.Lately, however, banks have reported much weaker earnings growth, and technology companieshave begun to announce layoffs in America. Therefore, on balance, downside risk to the globaleconomic outlook dominates.macroeconomic and Growth challenges in the Indian economy1.10 The impact of the pandemic on India was seen in a significant GDP contraction in FY21.The following year, FY22, the Indian economy started to recover despite the Omicron waveof January 2022. This third wave did not affect economic activity in India as much as theprevious waves of the pandemic did since its outbreak in January 2020. Mobility enabled bylocalised lockdowns, rapid vaccination coverage, mild symptoms and quick recovery from thevirus contributed to minimising the loss of economic output in the January-March quarter of2022. Consequently, output in FY22 went past its pre-pandemic level in FY20, with the Indianeconomy staging a full recovery ahead of many nations. The experience with the Omicronvariant engendered a cautious optimism that it was possible to stay physically mobile andengage in economic activities despite the pandemic. FY23 thus opened with a firm belief thatthe pandemic was rapidly on the wane and that India was poised to grow at a fast pace andquickly ascend to the pre-pandemic growth path. )erorChkaL₹tnecrePReal GDP FY20 Level Growth (RHS)Source: NSO, MoSPINote: AE stands for Advanced Estimates, PE stands for Provisional Estimates, RE stands for Revised Estimates 10 Economic Survey 2022-23Broad-based growth driven by Demand and Investment ERdr3(91YF)ERdn2(02YF)ERts1(12YF)EP(22YF)EAts1(32YFAgriculture and allied activitiesIndustryServices806040200PFCE GFCF Exports of Imports ofgoods and goods andservices servicesPDGfotnecrePFY19 (3rd RE) FY20 (2nd RE) FY21 (1st RE)FY22 (PE) FY23 (1st AE)Source: NSO, MoSPINote: AE stands for Advanced Estimates, PE stands for Provisional Estimates, RE stands for Revised Estimates ed to other emes1086420)YoY(tnecreP12-beF 12-rpA 12-nuJ 12-guA 12-tcO 12-ceD 22-beF 22-rpA 22-nuJ 22-guA 22-tcO 22-ceDCPI CPI-Food Depreciation (+)/Appreciation(-)against USD between Apr-Dec 2022South Africa 16.4Brazil 11.5Australia 10.0Indonesia 8.8India 8.8China 8.8UK 8.6Japan 7.7Euro 4.1South Korea 3.9Mexico -2.0Per centSource: MoSPI Source: Bloomberg, RBI (Exchange rates for Decemberas on 31st Dec 2022)1.11 However, the conflict in Europe necessitated a revision in expectations for economicgrowth and inflation in FY23. The country’s retail inflation had crept above the RBI’s tolerancerange in January 2022. It remained above the target range for ten months before returning tobelow the upper end of the target range of 6 per cent in November 2022. During those tenmonths, rising international commodity prices contributed to India’s retail inflation as also local State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 11weather conditions like excessive heat and unseasonal rains, which kept food prices high. Thegovernment cut excise and customs duties and restricted exports to restrain inflation while theRBI, like other central banks, raised the repo rates and rolled back excess liquidity.1.12 With monetary tightening, the US dollar has appreciated against several currencies,including the rupee. However, the rupee has been one of the better-performing currenciesworldwide, but the modest depreciation it underwent may have added to the domestic inflationarypressures besides widening the CAD. Global commodity prices may have eased but are stillhigher compared to pre-conflict levels. They have further widened the CAD, already enlargedby India's growth momentum.

For the advanced economies, inparticular, the enormous fiscal stimulus earlier injected by their governments supported astrong demand revival. Growth in world trade subsequently followed, of which India was alsoa beneficiary. India’s exports surged in FY22, and the momentum lasted up to the first halfof FY23. Export growth was strong enough to increase India’s share in the world market ofmerchandise exports. However, due to aggressive and synchronised monetary tightening, globaleconomic growth has started to slow, and so has world trade. As per United Nations Conferenceon Trade and Development (UNCTAD) latest global trade update, global trade growth turnednegative during the H2:2022, and geopolitical frictions, persisting inflationary pressures, andsubdued demand are expected to suppress global trade further in 2023. This is likely to affectmany countries, including India, with the prospects of sluggish exports continuing into FY24,compared to the promise shown at the beginning of the current year. 12 Economic Survey 2022-23 spite global slowdown4,0003,0002,0001,0000xednI91-raM 91-guA 02-naJ 02-nuJ 02-voN 12-rpA 12-peS 22-beF 22-luJ 22-ceD35 Baltic Dry Index3025201510Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q22019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23PDGlaeRfotnecrePExports of goods and servicesImports of goods and servicesSource: The Great Eastern Shipping Co.

As these developmentsposed downside risks to the growth of the Indian economy in FY23, many agencies worldwidehave been revising their growth forecast of the Indian economy downwards. These forecasts,including the advance estimates released by the NSO, now broadly lie in the range of 6.5-7.0 percent. Despite the downward revision, the growth estimate for FY23 is higher than for almostall major economies and even slightly above the average growth of the Indian economy in thedecade leading up to the pandemic. IMF estimates India to be one of the top two fast-growingsignificant economies in 2022. Despite strong global headwinds and tighter domestic monetarypolicy, if India is still expected to grow between 6.5 and 7.0 per cent, and that too without theadvantage of a base effect, it is a reflection of India’s underlying economic resilience; of itsability to recoup, renew and re-energise the growth drivers of the economy. %6.7%6.6%P&S BDA ydooM hctiF namdloGshcaSknaBdlroWIBR IBS FMI puorgitiC DCEOAverage Growth= 6.9%Source: Various AgenciesNote: ADB stands for Asian Development Bank, IMF is International Monetary Fund State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 131.15 India’s economic resilience can be seen in the domestic stimulus to growth seamlesslyreplacing the external stimuli. The growth of exports may have moderated in the second half ofFY23. However, their surge in FY22 and the first half of FY23 induced a shift in the gears ofthe production processes from mild acceleration to cruise mode. Manufacturing and investmentactivities consequently gained traction. By the time the growth of exports moderated, therebound in domestic consumption had sufficiently matured to take forward the growth of India’seconomy. Private Consumption as a percentage of GDP stood at 58.4 per cent in Q2 of FY23,the highest among the second quarters of all the years since 2013-14, supported by a rebound incontact-intensive services such as trade, hotel and transport, which registered sequential growthof 16 per cent in real terms in Q2 of FY23 compared to the previous quarter.1.16 Although domestic consumption rebounded in many economies, the rebound in India wasimpressive for its scale. It contributed to a rise in domestic capacity utilisation. Domestic privateconsumption remains buoyant in November 2022, as indicated by Motilal Oswal’s EconomicActivity Index. The index estimates that private consumption grew at a five-month high pace of5.6 per cent YoY, driven by auto sales and broad-based expansion of services.2 1YF:2Q 91YF:3Q 91YF:4Q 02YF:1Q 02YF:2Q 02YF:3Q 02YF:4Q 12YF:1Q 12YF:2Q 12YF:3Q 12YF:4Q 22YF:1Q 22YF:2Q 22YF:3Q 22YF:4Q 32YF:1Q 32YF:2Q 32YF:3QxednICapacity Utilisation BEI (RHS)Source: RBINote: BEI – Business Expectations Index1.17 The near-universal coverage of vaccination in India overseen by the government was thesingle most important reason that brought people out to the streets to re-experience the “bazaar”as the marketplace was rapidly populated with service providers returning to resume business.The contact-based service providers like restaurants, hotels, shopping malls, cinemas, and touristdestinations, among others, soon ran up a thriving business and have significantly contributedto keeping up the consumer sentiments, as captured in repeated surveys.

Since the share of consumption indisposable income is high in India, a pandemic-induced suppression of consumption built up thatmuch greater recoil force. Hence, the consumption rebound may have lasting power. Acceleratinggrowth in personal loans in India testifies to an enduring release of “pent-up” demand forconsumption. RBI’s most recent survey3 of consumer confidence released in December 2022 pointedto improving sentiment with respect to current and prospective employment and income conditions.1.19 The “release of pent-up demand” was reflected in the housing market too. Demand forhousing loans picked up. Consequently, housing inventories have declined, prices are firming up,and construction of new dwellings is picking up pace. This has stimulated innumerable backwardand forward linkages that the construction sector is known to carry. The universalisation ofvaccination coverage also has a significant role in lifting the housing market as, in its absence,the migrant workforce could not have returned to construct new dwellings. naJ 12-raM 12-yaM 12-luJ 12-peS 12-voN 22-naJ 22-raM 22-yaM 22-luJ 22-peS 22-voNHousing Bank credit growth (YoY)10 60840642020 01Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q 3QFY20 FY21 FY22 FY23hkaLtnecrePUnsold InventoryInventory Overhang (RHS)Source: RBI, PropTiger3 See https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=21569 State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 151.20 Apart from housing, construction activity, in general, has significantly risen in FY23 as themuch-enlarged capital budget (Capex) of the central government and its public sector enterprisesis rapidly being deployed.

As per the data on non-financial debt from the Bank for International Settlements, in thecourse of the last decade, Indian non-financial private sector debt and non-financial corporatedebt as a share of GDP declined by nearly thirty percentage points. This limited the increase ininterest costs, which, together with possible savings on overheads during lockdowns, contributedto the recent fortification of corporate balance sheets by higher profits. In FY22, the surge in State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 17exports also contributed to increasing profits in the corporate world. After-tax profits were alsoboosted by the lower taxes announced in 2019. Better profitability helped corporates pay downdebt. Consequently, not only do corporates have more scope to borrow now, but their improvedfinancial health has also reassured their prospective lenders to expand their credit portfolios. Asper Axis Bank Business and Economic Research, Capex by the Corporate sector increased to₹3.3 lakh crore in H1 of FY23, driven by heavy investments in electricity, steel, chemicals, autoand pharmaceuticals sectors.1.23 The banking sector in India has responded in equal measure to the demand for credit.The Year-on-Year growth in credit since the January-March quarter of 2022 has moved intodouble-digits and is rising across most sectors. The credit growth to the MSME sector hasbeen remarkably high, over 30.5 per cent, on average, during Jan-Nov 2022, supported by theextended ECLGS of the central government. The aggressive supply of credit by the bankingsector has as much been triggered by their improved financial health as that of the corporates.The finances of the public sector banks have seen a significant turnaround, with profits beingbooked at regular intervals and their Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) being fast-tracked forquicker resolution/liquidation by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). At thesame time, the government has been providing adequate budgetary support for keeping the PSBswell-capitalized, ensuring that their Capital Risk-Weighted Adjusted Ratio (CRAR) remainscomfortably above the threshold levels of adequacy. The successful macro stress tests performedon the banking sector further testify to its financial strength. It does help that the banking sectorhas negligible cross-border claims in times when currency risk is high. Nonetheless, financialstrength has helped banks make up for lower debt financing provided by corporate bonds andExternal Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) so far in FY23. Rising yields on corporate bondsand higher interest/hedging costs on ECBs have made these instruments less attractive than theprevious year. yaM 12-nuJ 12-luJ 12-guA 12-peS 12-tcO 12-voN 12-ceD 22-naJ 22-beF 22-raM 22-rpA 22-yaM 22-nuJ 22-luJ 22-guA 22-peS 22-tcO 22-voNMSMEs Large Industry Services Non-Food CreditSource: RBI 18 Economic Survey 2022-23 crePMar-20 Mar-21 Mar-22 Sep-2280757065605550PSBs PVBs FBs SCBstnecrePMar-20 Mar-21 Mar-22 Sep-22Source: RBINote: SCBs stand for Scheduled Commercial Banks, PSBs stand for Public Sector Banks, PVBs stand for PrivateSector Banks, FBs stands for Foreign Banks, GNPA stands for Gross Non-Performing Assets .57.56.55.54.53.5tnecreP12-beF 12-rpA 12-nuJ 12-guA 12-tcO 12-ceD 22-beF 22-rpA 22-nuJ 22-guA 22-tcO 22-ceD51 years 3 years5 years 10 years43210erorchkaL₹1H:02YF 2H:02YF 1H:12YF 2H:12YF 1H:22YF 2H:22YF 1H:32YFSource: Bloomberg Source: SEBI noilliB$SU1H:02YF 2H:02YF 1H:12YF 2H:12YF 1H:22YF 2H:22YF 1H:32YFSource: RBI State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 191.24 RBI has projected headline inflation at 6.8 per cent in FY23, which is outside its targetrange.

Both official and unofficial sources confirmthat employment levels have risen in the current financial year. The Periodic Labour ForceSurvey (PLFS) shows that the urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and abovedeclined from 9.8 per cent in the quarter ending September 2021 to 7.2 per cent one year later(quarter ending September 2022). This is accompanied by an improvement in the labour forceparticipation rate (LFPR) as well, confirming the emergence of the economy out of the pandemic-induced slowdown early in FY23. Job creation appears to have moved into a higher orbit withthe initial surge in exports, a strong release of the “pent-up” demand, and a swift rollout of thecapex. Since export growth is plateauing and the “pent-up” release of demand will have a finitelife, it is essential that capex continues to grow to facilitate employment in the economy, atleast until such time the global economy rebounds and, through the export channel, provides anadditional window to India for job creation. Thankfully, the private sector has all the necessarypre-conditions lined up to step up to the plate and do the capex heavy lifting.

Capital markets are willing to finance new investments, as are financial institutions.1.26 In FY21, the Government announced the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme. Thescheme has succeeded in shielding micro, small and medium enterprises from financial distress.A recent CIBIL report (ECLGS Insights, August 2022) showed that the scheme has supportedMSMEs in facing the covid shock, with 83 per cent of the borrowers that availed of the ECLGS 20 Economic Survey 2022-23being micro-enterprises.

Furthermore, CIBIL data also shows that ECLGS borrowers had lower non-performing asset rates than enterprises that were eligible for ECLGS but did not avail of it.Further, the GST paid by MSMEs after declining in FY21 has been rising since and now hascrossed the pre-pandemic level of FY20, reflecting the financial resilience of small businessesand the effectiveness of the pre-emptive government intervention targeted towards MSMEs. aM 02-nuJ 02-peS 02-ceD 12-raM 12-nuJ 12-peS 12-ceD 22-raM 22-nuJ 22-peSSource: NSO, MoSPI roving their asset quality6543210FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22erorChkaL₹Micro Medium Small6.6%6.0%5.5%5.0%4.6% 4.7%Micro Small MediumsecnalaBfotnecrePNPA Rate as on March 2022Availed ECLGS Eligible but did not avail ECLGSSource: Ministry of Finance Source: ECLGS Insights Report’, TransUnion CIBIL,Note: Includes firms with turnover up to ₹1000 crore.

In addition, schemeslike PM-KISAN, which benefits households covering half the rural population, and PM GaribKalyan Anna Yojana have significantly contributed to lessening impoverishment in the country.The UNDP Report of July 2022 stated that the recent inflationary episode in India would have alow poverty impact due to well-targeted support.

The economy has withstood the challenge of mitigating external imbalances causedby the Russian-Ukraine conflict without losing growth momentum in the process. India’s stockmarkets had a positive return in CY22, unfazed by withdrawals by foreign portfolio investors.India’s inflation rate did not creep too far above its tolerance range compared to several advancednations and regions. A relatively higher growth forecast among major economies, projectedretail inflation only slightly higher than the tolerance limit, and an estimated current accountdeficit financeable with normal capital inflows and forex reserves large enough to finance closeto a year’s imports are clear evidence of economic resilience amidst a global polycrisis. Strongconsumption rebound, robust revenue collections, sustained capex in both the public and theprivate sector, growing employment levels in the urban as well as the rural areas, and targetedsocial security measures further underpin the prospects for economic and social stability andsustained growth. India is the third-largest economy in the world in PPP terms and the fifth-largest in market exchange rates. As expected of a nation of this size, the Indian economy inFY23 has nearly “recouped” what was lost, “renewed” what had paused, and “re-energised”what had slowed during the pandemic and since the conflict in Europe.outlook: 2023-241.29 India’s recovery from the pandemic was relatively quick, and growth in the upcoming yearwill be supported by solid domestic demand and a pickup in capital investment. The current 22 Economic Survey 2022-23growth trajectory will be supported by multiple structural changes that have been implementedover the past few years. The private sector – financial and non-financial – was repairing balancesheets, which led to a slowdown in capital formation in the previous decade. The financialsystem stress experienced in the second decade of the millennium, evidenced by rising non-performing assets, low credit growth and declining growth rates of capital formation, causedby excessive lending witnessed in the first decade-plus, is now behind us. Aided by healthyfinancials, incipient signs of a new private sector capital formation cycle are visible. Moreimportantly, compensating for the private sector’s caution in capital expenditure, the governmentraised capital expenditure substantially. Budgeted capital expenditure rose 2.7X in the last sevenyears, from FY16 to FY23, re-invigorating the Capex cycle. Structural reforms such as theintroduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code enhancedthe efficiency and transparency of the economy and ensured financial discipline and bettercompliance.  2023FtnecrePReal GDP Growth WTO's Trade Volume GrowthSource: IMF, WTONote: F stands for Forcast1.30 Even as India’s outlook remains bright, global economic prospects for the next year havebeen weighed down by the combination of a unique set of challenges expected to impart a fewdownside risks. Multi-decadal high inflation numbers have compelled central banks across theglobe to tighten financial conditions. The impact of monetary tightening is beginning to show inslowing economic activity, especially in Advanced Economies. Besides this, adverse spilloversfrom the prolonged strains in supply chains and heightened uncertainty due to geo-politicalconflict have further deteriorated the global outlook. Hence, global growth is forecasted to slowfrom 3.2 per cent in 2022 to 2.7 per cent in 2023 as per IMF’s World Economic Outlook,October 2022. A slower growth in economic output coupled with increased uncertainty willdampen trade growth. This is seen in the lower forecast for growth in global trade by the WorldTrade Organisation, from 3.5 per cent in 2022 to 1.0 per cent in 2023.1.31 On the external front, risks to the current account balance stem from multiple sources.While commodity prices have retreated from record highs, they are still above pre-conflictlevels. Strong domestic demand amidst high commodity prices will raise India’s total import State of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete 23bill and contribute to unfavourable developments in the current account balance. These may beexacerbated by plateauing export growth on account of slackening global demand. Should thecurrent account deficit widen further, the currency may come under depreciation pressure.1.32 Another risk to the outlook originates from the ongoing monetary tightening exercise.While the pace of rate hikes has slowed, major central banks have reaffirmed their hawkish stanceon inflation. Entrenched inflation may prolong the tightening cycle, and therefore, borrowingcosts may stay ‘higher for longer’. In such a scenario, global economy may be characterisedby low growth in FY24. However, the scenario of subdued global growth presents two silverlinings – oil prices will stay low, and India’s CAD will be better than currently projected. Theoverall external situation will remain manageable.1.33 The upside to India’s growth outlook arises from (i) limited health and economic falloutfor the rest of the world from the current surge in Covid-19 infections in China and, therefore,continued normalisation of supply chains; (ii) inflationary impulses from the reopening ofChina’s economy turning out to be neither significant nor persistent; (iii) recessionary tendenciesin major AEs triggering a cessation of monetary tightening and a return of capital flows to Indiaamidst a stable domestic inflation rate below 6 per cent; and (iv) this leading to an improvementin animal spirits and providing further impetus to private sector investment.1.34 Against this backdrop, the survey projects a baseline GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in realterms in FY24. The projection is broadly comparable to the estimates provided by multilateralagencies such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the ADB and by RBI, domestically. The actualoutcome for real GDP growth will probably lie in the range of 6.0 per cent to 6.8 per cent,depending on the trajectory of economic and political developments globally.****** 02IndIa's MedIuM -TerMGrowTh ouTlook: wIThCHAPTERopTIMIsM and hope2014-2022 is an important period in the economic history of India. The economy underwenta gamut of wide-ranging structural and governance reforms that strengthened theeconomy’s fundamentals by enhancing its overall efficiency. With an underlying emphasison improving the ease of living and doing business, the reforms were based on the broadprinciples of creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering withthe private sector for development, and improving agricultural productivity. Under normalcircumstances, reforms of such scale and relevance would have accelerated economicgrowth. However, largely due to the balance sheet stress caused by the credit boom inthe previous years and secondarily due to the one-off global shocks that followed, keymacroeconomic variables such as credit growth, capital formation, and hence economicgrowth were adversely impacted during this period. Further, some reforms deliver resultswith lagged effects as their diffusion in the economy takes time.This situation is analogous to the period 1998-2002 when transformative reforms undertakenby the government had lagged growth returns due to temporary shocks in the economy. Oncethese shocks faded, the structural reforms paid growth dividends from 2003. Similarly, inthe present decade, the presence of strong medium-term growth magnets gives us optimismand hope that once these global shocks of the pandemic and the spike in commodity pricesin 2022 fade away, the Indian economy is well placed to grow faster in the coming decade.With improved and healthier balance sheets of the banking, non-banking and corporatesectors, a fresh credit cycle has already begun, evident from the double-digit growth inbank credit over the past months. Additionally, the economy has started benefiting fromthe efficiency gains resulting from greater formalisation, higher financial inclusion, andeconomic opportunities created by digital technology-based economic reforms. Thus, India’sgrowth outlook seems better than in the pre-pandemic years, and the Indian economy isprepared to grow at its potential in the medium term.Introduction2.1 Indian economy has undergone a transformative process of New Age reforms in thelast eight years. These diverse policies converge towards improving the economy’s overallefficiency and lifting its potential growth. To achieve the broader policy goal of unleashing theproductive potential of the economy and its people, the reforms aimed at enhancing the ease ofliving and doing business at the fundamental level. The use of technology, in particular digitaltechnology, undergirds the reforms. The economic energy and positive mindset that the reformsunleashed would have led to a sharp acceleration in growth but for the balance sheet repair of India's Medium-Term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope 25the over-leveraged domestic financial sector (banking & non-banking) and the corporate sectorand secondarily to the one-off global shocks that followed.2.2 With the impetus of the persistent structural and governance reforms introduced in thecountry and strong macroeconomic stability, it is essential to get a handle on the medium-termgrowth outlook for India. Will the economy achieve and sustain a steady growth rate once theone-off shocks recede? This chapter attempts to answer this question and concludes that thechances of India growing at its potential and for the potential growth itself to be lifted are higherthan it has been in the last two decades. The chapter starts with a brief discussion of the historyof India’s product and capital market reforms over the previous three decades. It further delvesinto the overarching philosophy behind the landmark reforms undertaken from 2014 to 2022and elaborates on the shocks faced by the Indian economy during this period. It concludes witha discussion on the medium-term growth magnets for India.product and Capital Market reformsInitiation of the reforms- 19912.3 The macroeconomic imbalances of the late 1980s and early 1990s pushed the governmenttowards introducing the structural reforms of 1991. The high combined deficit of the centraland state governments, elevated inflationary pressures, and large and unsustainable currentaccount deficit (CAD) led to a balance of payments crisis in the Indian economy.1 In responseto the situation, trade and investments were liberalised in 1991. Import licensing on almost allintermediate inputs and capital goods was done away with, and the entry restrictions for firmswere simplified. The new policy encouraged the entry of private sector firms by ending thepublic sector monopoly in many sectors and initiating the automatic approval policy for FDIup to 51 per cent. The exchange rate was made flexible and allowed to depreciate as necessaryto maintain competitiveness. The rupee was made fully convertible on the current account andpartially on the capital account. These reforms had a positive effect on the economy. The realgrowth went up from an average of 5.5 per cent during the 1980s to 6.3 per cent from FY93 toFY2000. Trade liberalisation had a visible effect on external trade as the total goods and servicestrade to GDP rose from 17.2 per cent in 1990 to 30.6 per cent in 2000.2Continuity in reforms with a renewed Impetus2.4 The product and capital market reforms continued slowly over the decade of the 1990s.They got a renewed impetus from the government closer to the decade’s end. Investments wereliberalised further to encourage Foreign Direct Investment as a main source of non-debt-creatingcapital inflows (Figure II.1). The telecom sector was entirely reformed by the New TelecomPolicy 1999. It was opened for private sector participation with a strengthened regulatory regime(TRAI). The reforms separated the licensing and policy functions of the government from that ofan operator (BSNL). These reforms were a cornerstone for the IT sector boom in India and hadwidespread spillover benefits to other sectors of the economy. The policy on disinvestment andprivatisation also gathered steam during this period. The government set up a dedicated Ministryto take this agenda forward. It sold equity stakes in some CPSEs and privatised companies suchas Maruti Udyog, Hindustan Zinc, Bharat Aluminum, and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited.1 History of Reserve bank of India-Volume IV (https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/RHvol-4.aspx)2 Arvind Panagariya, 2004. “India in the 1980’s and 1990’s: A Triumph of Reforms,”IMF Working Papers2004/043, International MonetaryFund.

The project brought significant economic benefits to the countrythrough enhanced connectivity, improved industrial activity, trade, and economic growth.3Alongside this, structural policies were formulated to address the macroeconomic imbalances.The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act was passed to address thehistoric highs of the combined Gross fiscal deficit of the Government (Figure II.2). The bankingsystem, which had accumulated bad debts during the period of economic resurgence after the1991 reforms, was supported through the deregulation of interest rates and the enactment of theSARFAESI Act 2002. Interest rates were deregulated to promote competition amongst banks,provide more banking options to depositors, and strengthen monetary policy transmission.4 TheSARFAESI Act allowed banks and financial institutions to recover their dues by proceedingagainst the secured assets of the borrower/guarantor without the intervention of the court/tribunals.5 Both these reforms improved the credit situation in the economy (Figure II.3).Figure II.2: Gross Fiscal deficit (centre and Figure II.3: Growth in non-Food Credit bystates combined) (% of Gdp) scheduled Commercial Banks12 PostFRBM1086420PDGfotnecreP88YF 09YF 29YF 49YF 69YF 89YF 00YF 20YF 40YF 60YF 80YF35302520151050tnecreP79YF 00YF 30YF 60YF 90YF 21YF 51YF 81YF 12YFSource: RBI Source: RBI3 Ghani, Ejaz & Grover, Arti & Kerr, William.

The sanctions imposed by the US on India after India’s nucleartest led to a sharp decline in capital flows to India during the months following the nuclear tests(Figure II.4)6. The period between 2000 and 2002 also witnessed two successive droughts (TableII.1). These domestic shocks were accompanied by heightened global uncertainties resultingfrom the end of a tech boom and the 9/11 attacks (Figure II.5). Moreover, the balance sheets ofthe Indian financial system and corporate sector were under-repair during the period. Thoughall these factors overshadowed the immediate impact of reforms undertaken by the governmentthen, they laid the groundwork and prepared the Indian economy structurally to participate inthe Global boom which followed soon after.Figure II.4: Monthly Foreign direct Figure II.5: Trends in the nasdaQInvestment came down (1998) Composite index (dot-Com Bubble crisis)5004003002001000noillim$SU79-rpA 79-nuJ 79-guA 79-tcO 79-ceD 89-beF 89-rpA 89-nuJ 89-guA600050004000300020001000089-naJ 89-luJ 99-naJ 99-luJ 00-naJ 00-luJ 10-naJ 10-luJ 20-naJ 20-luJSource: RBI Source: FREDTable II.1: occurrence, number of people affected and damagesof droughts in India between 2000 and 2002date location numbersGujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Affected- 9 crore; Damage-Apr 2000Orissa, Maharashtra US$588,000,000Mahasamund, Raipur, Kawardha, Rajnandgaon, DurgNov 2000districts (Chhattisgarh region)May 2001 New Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Orissa 20 deathsUttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana,Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Nagaland, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Affected-30 crore;Jul 2002Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Damage- US$910,721,000Tamil NaduSource: Samra, J.

The years of structural reforms had prepared the Indian economy tocontribute to global growth and also benefit from it. While the global growth averaged 4.8per cent during 2003-2008, the Indian economy grew at more than 8 per cent on average. Theeconomic growth during the period was supported by strong capital inflows (Figure II.1), whichindicated favourable domestic and external factors. Some of these included sustained momentumin domestic economic activity, better corporate performance, a conducive investment climate,positive sentiments for India as a preferred investment destination, and encouraging globalliquidity conditions/ interest rates.7 This combination of structural economic reforms with theirlagged effect on economic growth has parallels to what is unfolding in the Indian economypresently.reforms for new India-sabka saath sabka Vikaas2.8 The reforms undertaken before 2014 primarily catered to product and capital market space.They were necessary and continued post-2014 as well. The government, however, imparted anew dimension to these reforms in the last eight years. With an underlying emphasis on enhancingthe ease of living and doing business and improving economic efficiency, the reforms are wellplaced to lift the economy’s potential growth. The broad principles behind the reforms werecreating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with the private sectorfor development, and improving agricultural productivity (Figure II.6). This approach reflectsa paradigm shift in the growth and development strategy of the government, with the emphasisshifted towards building partnerships amongst various stakeholders in the development process,where each contributes to and reaps the development benefits (Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas).Figure II.6: underlying framework for reforms for a new Indiaenhancing productive potential of economy and its peopleEfficient resource allocationAgriculturalCreating public goodsproductivityease of doingbusiness + ease oflivingTrust-based Private sectorgovernance participation2.9 While the reforms undertaken in the post-2014 period have multiple socioeconomicbenefits for the economy, this chapter focuses on the growth-centric aspects of these reforms.7 Mohan, Rakesh, (2008), Capital flows to India, p. 235-263 in Settlements, Bank for International eds., Financial globalisation and emergingmarket capital flows, vol. 44, Bank for International Settlements, (https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap44m.pdf) India's Medium-Term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope 29The forthcoming section discusses how each of the principles that anchor the new reformframework contributes to enhancing the productive potential of the economy and its people.These have more profound positive implications for India’s medium-term growth outlook.I. Creating public goods to enhance opportunities, efficiencies and ease of living2.10 The launch of the Golden Quadrilateral project in the 2000s was the beginning ofinfrastructure-intensive policymaking in India, which continued sedately for another decade.A quantum leap in policy commitment and outlay for infrastructure is now visible in the lastfew years (Figure II.7), cushioning economic growth when the non-financial corporate sectorwas unable to invest due to balance sheet troubles. In doing so, the government has laid a goodplatform for crowding in private investments and growth in the coming decade. 8Figure: II.7: union government’s capital expenditure as a per cent of Gdp on the rise8 3.573.0652.542.0 321.510 1.0FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23PA BEerorchkalsRtnecrePCentre's Capital Expenditure as a per cent of GDP (RHS) Centre's Capital Expenditure (Rs lakh crore)Source: RBI, MoSPI, O/o CGA2.11 The dedicated programs for road connectivity (Bharatmala), port infrastructure(Sagarmala), electrification, railways upgradation, and operationalising new airports/ airroutes (UDAN) have significantly improved the physical infrastructure in the last few years(Figure II.8). The details on the upgradation of physical infrastructure may be seen in Chapter12. With the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) in 2019 and the National MonetizationPipeline in 2021, a strong baseline for infrastructure creation and development has been put inplace, providing a multitude of opportunities for foreign investment and engagement. The NIPwas launched with 6,835 infrastructure projects with a projected infrastructure investment of₹111 lakh crore. This has expanded to over 9,000 projects across 35 sub-sectors and coverseconomic and social infrastructure projects jointly funded by the Central Government, StateGovernments, and the private sector. With its strong forward and backward linkages, physicalinfrastructure will enhance the economy’s productivity in the medium term.8 ‘Crowding-Out or Crowding-In?

A recently published article9 in the RBI’sMonthly Bulletin estimates that India’s core digital economy has grown at 2.4 times the overalleconomic growth between 2014 and 2019. With its strong forward linkages to the non-digitalsectors, digitalisation strengthens potential economic growth through various channels. Someof these, such as higher financial inclusion, greater formalisation, increased efficiencies andenhanced opportunities, are discussed below.2.13 Based on the pillars of a digital identity Aadhar, linking bank accounts with PM-JanDhan Yojana, and the penetration of mobile phones (JAM Trinity), the country has witnessedsignificant progress in financial inclusion in recent years. The population covered with bankaccounts increased from 53 per cent in 2015-16 to 78 per cent in 2019-21 (as per NFHS).International evidence shows that countries at the same level of development have taken almosthalf a century to achieve the extent of India’s massive expansion in access to bank accounts(D’Silva et al. 2019)10. Numerous digital public goods such as digital verification (e-KYC),digital signature, digital repositories (Digilocker), and digital payments (UPI) have supportedfinancial inclusion by improving access to formal financial services and reducing transactioncosts. 11 Greater financial inclusion and access to credit incentivise higher consumption andinvestment, leading to higher economic growth. Some of the recently introduced digitalinitiatives, such as the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and Account Aggregatorframework, will open up further avenues for e-commerce market access and credit availabilityfor smaller businesses and strengthen the expected economic growth in the medium term.9 Dhirendra Gajbhiye et al. (2022), ‘Measuring India’s Digital Economy’, RBI Monthly Bulletin December 2022 (https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Bulletin/PDFs/05ART201220221265B8E871824B98970F03E87228C0FE.PDF)10 D’Silva, Derryl and Filková, Zuzana and Packer, Frank and Tiwari, Siddharth, The Design of Digital Financial Infrastructure: Lessons fromIndia (December 15, 2019).

A report in The Economist (January 2023) attributes the trends of formalisation of theworkforce in India to the transformed digital financial architecture, the digitalised GST systemand growth in the usage of UPI.12 The creation of digital identities such as Aadhar, registrationof unorganised workers on the eshram portal, street vendors on SVANidhi, taxpaying firmson GSTN, and MSMEs on the Udayam portal, has played a significant role in the inclusion ofthese groups under the formal economic net. As an illustration, we can now track that out ofthe 1.27 crore enterprises registered on the Udyam Portal, more than 93,000 micro-enterpriseshave grown to become small enterprises, and 10,000 small enterprises have become mediumenterprises over the last two years. 13 Creating an identity has also simplified and enabled accessto formal credit for many of these groups. More than 32.7 lakh street vendors have availed ofa first loan of ₹10,000 under the PM SVANidhi Scheme, and of these, more than 6.9 lakh haveavailed a second loan of ₹20,000. Moreover, digital systems such as the Goods and Services TaxNetwork (GSTN) and e-Way Bill system have enabled the formalisation of business transactions.The increasing number of GST taxpayers, from 70 lakh in 201714 to more than 1.4 crore in2022, indicates the expansion in formal businesses. Formalisation of transactions, for even thesmallest of amounts, has been possible with the wide usage of the digital payment system ofUPI. The greater formalisation will enhance the productivity of individuals and businesses in theeconomy through improved access to credit and efficiency gains in their operations.2.15 Gains from economic and structural reforms tend to be more significant when the bindingconstraints of governance have been addressed.15 Unified digital interfaces that connect variousinitiatives/portals have simplified governance resulting in a more efficient resource allocationin the economy. The National Single Window System for business approvals, the JanSamarthportal for credit-linked Central Government scheme, and the UMANG app for access toCentral and state government services are essential steps towards enhancing the ease of doingbusiness through the integration of existing systems. Eshram portal, with more than 28.5 croreregistered workers, has been integrated with various other digital portals for easy accessibility.PM Gatishakti, the GIS-based platform that brings together multiple ministries for integratedplanning and coordinated implementation of multimodal infrastructure connectivity projects,aims to reduce logistics costs. Thus, digitaltechnologies being at the forefront of the reformsprovide a unique opportunity to accelerate India’s economic growth. More details on the stridesin digital infrastructure may be seen in chapter 12.II. Trust-based Governance2.16 Building trust between the government and the citizens/businesses unleashes efficiencygains through improved investor sentiment, better ease of doing business, and more effectivegovernance. Consistent reforms have been made in this direction during the last eight years.Simplification of regulatory frameworks through reforms such as the Insolvency and BankruptcyCode (IBC) and the Real Estate(Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) have enhanced theease of doing business. The IBC has imbibed some of the best international practices of an asset12 ‘Imagine an India without hawkers’, The Economist January 2023. (https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/05/imagine-an-india-without-hawkers)13 https://pqars.nic.in/annex/257/AU904.pdf14 PMEAC Report- ‘GST-Connecting the remaining dots’, June 202215 IMF World Economic Outlook 2019 32 Economic Survey 2022-23resolution mechanism. It provides an honourable exit mechanism for honest business failuresand enables the release of credit locked into the stressed assets for better resource allocation.This market-driven, transparent resolution mechanism instils confidence in the financial systemand attracts many new investors to invest in Indian businesses.16 A significant achievement ofthe IBC has been the change brought in the debtor-creditor relationship. Debtors are resolvingstress early to avoid being pushed into insolvency. Until 30 September 2022, 23,417 applicationsfor initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of corporate debtors havingunderlying defaults of ₹7.3 lakh crore were disposed of before their admission into CIRP. 172.17 The other regulatory reform, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), iscreating a culture of transparent transactions in the real estate sector.18 The Act has transformedthe real estate sector by registering real estate brokers and agents with the regulator, establishingmechanisms for the speedy redressal of disputes and enabling a single window clearance fortimely approvals to the developers. The Real Estate Regulatory Authorities across the countryhave disposed off more than 1.06 lakh complaints. With 99262 projects and 71514 agents alreadyregistered under RERA, the Act incentivises more investments into the sector.2.18 Another significant reform to enhance doing business has been the decriminalisation ofminor economic offences under the Companies Act of 2013 (Table II.2). By introducing civilliabilities for dealing with simple defaults that do not involve fraud or where the nature ofthe lapse is purely procedural, the government has demonstrated its intent to promote ease ofdoing business for domestic and global investors. Furthermore, a trust-based approach towardscompliance builds entrepreneurs’ faith in corporate institutions and motivates them to adoptfairer and more transparent business practices. After the reform, more than 1400 default caseshave been decided without resorting to the court. Also, more than 4,00,000 companies havewillingly rectified past defaults to avoid penalties under the Companies Act.19Table II.2: snapshot on decriminalisation of offences under the Companies act, 2013post-decriminalisationpre-decriminalisation[in two phases]Total penal provisions 134 124Compoundable offences [mostly fines are 81 31imposed]Non-compoundable offences [serious offences 35 35where imprisonment is ordered upon conviction]Defaults subject to civil liability (through In 18 58House Adjudication Mechanism)2.19 The removal of policy uncertainties has favourable implications for strengthening the trustbetween the government and its citizens.

These efforts haveimproved investor sentiments and strengthened the growth potential.2.20 In particular, the taxation ecosystem in the country has undergone substantial reforms inthe post-2014 period. Tax policy reforms such as adopting a unified GST, reducing corporatetax rates, exemption of sovereign wealth funds and pension funds from taxes, and removingthe Dividend Distribution tax have reduced the tax burden on individuals and businesses; andhave removed the distortionary incentives from the economy. GST, for instance, has helpedbusinesses by reducing compliances, ensuring a free flow of goods across states, doing awaywith the need for businesses to have a separate warehouse for every state, and hence improvingthe ease of doing business. The earlier indirect tax regime was origin based, and it distorted thelocation choices of the businesses.2.21 Despite tax rationalisation, a positive trend of higher tax buoyancy is visible in theeconomy. The notable economist Indira Rajaraman termed GST ‘a revenue success’ in 201920;thereafter, the positive GST revenue collection trends have strengthened further despite thepandemic. The average monthly gross GST collection has increased from ₹0.90 lakh crore inFY18 to ₹1.49 lakh crore in FY23 (Figure II.9). Evidence suggests that the buoyancy of theindirect tax system replaced by GST has improved in the post-GST regime (Box III.1, Chapter3). Since other tax reforms, such as the corporate tax cut, were followed by the pandemic-leduncertainty and disruptions, their impact on collections is gradually becoming visible in highertax collections. The Corporate tax collections for April to November 2022 have increased by21.1 per cent on a YoY basis compared to a longer-term average YoY growth of 10.3 per centduring the corresponding period from FY13 to FY19.Figure II.9: rising average monthly gross GsT collection1.61.491.51.41.3 1.241.21.1 1.020.981.0 0.950.900.90.80.70.6FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23erorchkal₹Source: Department of Revenue20 Monograph titled ‘The evolving GST’ delivered by Indira Rajaraman as the Chelliah Memorial Lecture at the Madras School of Economicsin 2019. (https://www.mse.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Monograph-43.pdf ) 34 Economic Survey 2022-232.22 One prominent reason behind the higher revenue buoyancy is the introduction oftechnology-backed tax governance reforms for simplifying tax processes, enhancing compliance,and improving fraud detection systems. The faceless assessment and appeal systems no longerrequire a physical interface between taxpayers and the Income Tax department. Moreover,multiple consistency checks possible with integrated digital systems reduce tax evasion. Asan illustration, the GST return filing mechanism results in better income reporting, leading tohigher direct tax collections. In this regard, the decision to share data and information betweenCBDT and CBIC on an automatic and regular basis is a promising reform, and it would resultin efficiency gains in the tax system. These reforms augur well for future economic growth andfuture resource mobilisation in the economy.III. promoting the private sector as a co-partner in the development2.23 A fundamental principle behind the government’s policy in the post- 2014 period hasbeen the engagement with the private sector as a partner in the development process. Thegovernment’s disinvestment policy has been revived in the last eight years with stake sales andthe successful listing of PSEs on the stock market. During FY15 to FY23 (as of 18 January2023), an amount of about ₹4.07 lakh crore has been realised as proceeds from disinvestmentthrough 154 transactions using various modes/instruments. The privatisation of Air India wasparticularly significant for re-igniting the privatisation drive. Evidence shows that privatisationhas improved labour productivity and the overall efficiency of the PSUs disinvested during1990-2015.21 The New Public Sector Enterprise Policy for Aatmanirbhar Bharat has thus beenintroduced to realise higher efficiency gains by minimising the presence of the government inthe PSEs to only a few strategic sectors.2.24 Significant initiatives have been introduced under Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Make in Indiaprogrammes to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities and exports across the industries. Sector-specific Production Linked incentives (PLI) have been introduced in the aftermath of the pandemic toincentivise domestic and foreign investments and to develop global Champions in the manufacturingindustry. The PLI scheme will significantly boost production, exports and employment in the mediumterm; however, its impact will be visible only with time. Early estimates of the impact of PLI showencouraging trends in some sectors. The PLI scheme for large-scale electronics manufacturing hasattracted an investment of ₹4,784 crore and contributed to a total production of ₹2.04 lakh crore,including exports of ₹80,769 crore (as of September 2022)22. The need for a dedicated governmentpolicy to support domestic industrialisation amidst foreign competition can be better appreciatedfrom the industrialisation experiences of East Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan in1960-1990. These countries supported their domestic industries during their high growth phase,while also ensuring healthy competition required for the industries to grow. 232.25 Production incentives under Aatmanirbhar Bharat also incentivise foreign investments fordomestic production. The last eight years have seen further liberalisation of the policy towardsforeign investors, with most sectors now open for 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) underthe automatic route. This has resulted in a visible structural shift in the gross FDI flows to India21 Chhibber, Ajay & Gupta, Swati, 2017. “Bolder Disinvestment or Better Performance Contracts? Which Way Forward for India’s State-Owned Enterprises,”Working Papers17/205, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.22 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=188518923 Jostein Hauge, 2020. “Industrial policy in the era of global value chains: Towards a developmentalist framework drawing on theindustrialisation experiences of South Korea and Taiwan,” The World Economy, Wiley Blackwell, vol. 43(8), pages 2070-2092, August. India's Medium-Term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope 35during the last decade. India’s gross FDI has increased from an average of 2.2 per cent of GDPduring FY05-FY14 to 2.6 per cent in FY15-FY22 (Figure II.10). The highest-ever annual grossFDI inflow of USD 84.8 billion was recorded in FY22. These trends are an endorsement ofIndia’s status as a preferred investment destination amongst global investors.Figure II.10: structural shift in the Gross FdI/Gdp during 2014-154.03.53.02.62.5 2.22.01.51.00.50.0PDGfotnecreP50YF 60YF 70YF 80YF 90YF 01YF 11YF 21YF 31YF 41YF 51YF 61YF 71YF 81YF 91YF 02YF 12YF 22YFSource: RBI Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy (FDI data); International Monetary FundWorld Economic Outlook database (Oct.2020) for US dollar GDP at current prices2.26 The government is developing enabling infrastructure for making India a cost-effectiveproduction hub. The National Logistics Policy (2022)24 has been launched to create an overarchinglogistics ecosystem for lowering the cost of logistics and bringing it to par with other developedcountries. This would boost economic growth, provide employment opportunities, and makeIndian products more competitive in the global market. Moreover, opening the strategic sectors,such as defence, mining and space, for the private sector has enhanced the business opportunitiesin the economy. Investment incentives and easing business compliances have created an ecosystemfor the start-ups to nurture. The number of recognised Start-ups has increased from 452 in 2016 to84,012 in 2022. More details on reforms for industries may be seen in Chapter 9.2.27 Reforms to address the structural challenges faced by MSMEs have been a vital part ofthe industrial policy in recent years. Support measures for MSMEs during the pandemic in theform of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and revision in the definitionof MSMEs under the ambit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat helped them face the crisis shock. TheECLGS, in particular, has in the last two years benefited 1.14 crore MSMEs, which have availedcollateral-free loans amounting to ₹2.38 lakh crore. Further measures, such as the introductionof TReDS to address the delayed payments for MSMEs, the inclusion of Retail and Wholesaletrades as MSMEs, and the extension of non-tax benefits for three years in case of an upwardchange in the status of MSMEs, have created a resilient support system for the MSME sectorto grow. The MSMEs have also benefitted from access to digital platforms for their marketingneeds and easy payments. With the Open Network for Digital Commerce creating opportunitiesfor MSMEs to access e-commerce technology and diversify their target markets, this trendwill likely strengthen further. Moreover, onboarding GSTN as a Financial information provider24 Details in Chapter 12 36 Economic Survey 2022-23on the Account aggregator platform will open up avenues for access to credit for MSMEs.Enhancing opportunities and productivity of the MSME sector have large-scale implications fora resilient production ecosystem, thus strengthening the growth prospects of the industry and theeconomy as a whole. These reforms, therefore, must continue.IV. enhancing productivity in agriculture2.28 The agriculture sector in India has grown at an average annual growth rate of 4.6 per centduring the last six years. This growth is partly attributable to good monsoon years and partly tothe various reforms undertaken by the government to enhance agricultural productivity. Policiessuch as Soil Health Cards, the Micro irrigation Fund, and organic and natural farming have helpedthe farmers optimise resource use and reduce the cultivation cost. The promotion of FarmerProducer Organisations (FPOs) and the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) extension Platformhave empowered farmers, enhanced their resources, and enabled them to get good returns. AgriInfrastructure Fund (AIF) has supported the creation of various agriculture infrastructures. KisanRail exclusively caters to the movement of perishable Agri Horti commodities. Cluster DevelopmentProgramme (CDP) has promoted integrated and market-led development for horticulture clusters.Support for creating a Start-up ecosystem in agriculture and allied sectors is also being providedto the farmers. All these measures are directed towards supporting the growth in agriculturalproductivity and sustaining its contribution to overall economic growth in the medium term.returns to the economic and structural reforms after 2014shocks that the economy faced during 2014-222.29 Under normal circumstances, comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms undertaken in theeconomy during the last eight years (as covered in the previous section) would have acceleratedIndia’s growth. But that was not to be. The ‘culprit’ is India’s balance sheet stress caused by thecredit boom in previous years. As per data from the Bank for International Settlements, India’snon-financial private sector debt to GDP ratio went up from 72.9 per cent in March 2004 to 113.6per cent by December 2010. That is an increase of 40.7 percentage points in just over six years.In rupee terms, the amount of debt accumulated by the non-financial sector went up from nearly44 lakh crore to almost 133 lakh crore. It trebled in six years. Despite limited economic reforms,global capital flows and optimism about BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa)triggered a domestic credit and investment boom that eventually proved unsustainable, as thetwin deficit – fiscal and external - crisis of 2013 revealed. Thereafter the non-financial privatesector debt to GDP ratio began to come down meaningfully only from 2015 onwards, droppingto a low of 83.8 per cent by December 2018. That is nearly a 30 percentage point reduction from113.6 per cent in December 2010 over eight years.2.30 Unsurprisingly, the credit to the private non-financial sector as a per cent of GDP wasconsistently below its trend value for most of the second decade of the millennium, implying anegative credit gap to GDP ratio (Figure II.11). The gap worsened to an unprecedented level of25 per cent in 2017. A statistically significant negative correlation (-0.5) between the Gross NPAsand credit growth shows that the banks’ credit supply was severely constrained due to stress intheir balance sheet during the second decade.25 That explains the large negative deviation of thecredit-to-GDP ratio from its trend.25 Muduli, S. and Behera, H., 2021. Bank capital and monetary policy transmission in India. Macroeconomics and Finance in EmergingMarket Economies, pp.1-25. (https://bit.ly/3J9xvNG) India's Medium-Term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope 37Figure II.11: Quarterly Credit to Gdp Gap remained negative for most of the 2010sSource: BIS2.31 As investments made by companies went sour, it impaired their ability to repay bankloans. Hence, banks’ non-performing assets began to rise. That set in motion a long periodof repair of the financial and non-financial sector balance sheets in the second half of the lastdecade. The government and the RBI took several policy initiatives to help the financial sectorrecoup the balance sheet stress during the 2010s. Some of these such as the amendment to theSARFAESI Act 2002, implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), launchof ‘Asset Quality Review’ (AQR), introduction of prompt corrective action (PCA) framework,recapitalisation of Public Sector Banks (PSB), and merger of PSBs among others, helped incleaning up the balance sheets of banks/corporates.2.32 Even as the balance sheets of banks and companies began to mend and improve, came thecollapse of the Infrastructure Finance and Leasing Services (IL&FS) in September 2018. It wasa big non-banking financial company (NBFC) with a huge asset base. Its collapse also had ahuge ripple effect on other non-banking financial entities. Few housing finance companies wentunder as well. Hence, housing loan disbursements were disrupted. Usually, non-banking financecompanies lend to more borrowers and riskier borrowers than banks. They are refinanced bybanks. Their re-financings came down in the wake of the collapse of IL&FS, a big NBFC,followed by the collapse of some housing finance companies. Therefore, bank credit growthcame down to single digits towards the end of 2019, continuing into 2020. Low credit growthand hence weaker capital formation impacted economic growth.2.33 The government responded with several measures to stem the fallout of the collapse ofIL&FS and housing finance companies, including a corporate tax cut in September 2019. Soonthereafter, the pandemic struck, and the government had to address the emerging health, socialand economic consequences of unprecedented nature. These have been discussed in detail inthe previous two economic surveys of 2020-21 and 2021-22. These back-to-back shocks havedelayed the impact of such momentous reforms on the economic growth. 38 Economic Survey 2022-23The period 2014-2022 is analogous to the period 1998-20022.34 India’s recent economic history provides a similar parallel to this situation. During 1998-2002, transformative reforms were launched but yielded lagged growth dividends (Table II.3).This phenomenon was attributed to a series of one-off shocks resulting from external factorsand the domestic financial sector clean-up, which overshadowed the growth returns from 1998to 200226. By 2003, when the shocks dissipated, India participated in the global boom and grewat a higher rate. Similarly, in the present context, as the global shocks of the pandemic and thespike in commodity prices in 2022 fade away, the Indian economy is well placed to grow at itspotential in the coming decade.Table II.3: a parallel between the periods: 1998-2002 and 2014-20221998-2002 2014-2022shocks to the economy Nuclear device testing 1998; sanctions  Period of Banking, Non-Banking and Non-followed Financial Corporate Sector Balance-sheetstress Banking and Corporate Sector deleveraging  Unprecedented pandemic shock followedand repairing balance-sheets by inflation global commodity price shockfollowed by tightening of financial conditions Two successive droughts Technology bust; US recession and 09/11structural reforms in the economy Interest rate deregulation  Unique Identity Privatisation  Financial Inclusion Asset Recovery for banks  GST leading to formalisation Infrastructure (Golden quadrilateral)  Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code FRBM Act  Privatisation Tax rates rationalisation and tax administrationreforms Decriminalisation of offences Vaccines roll-out Expenditure Management Reforms AatmaNirbhar Bharat Public Digital InfrastructureGrowth returns One-off shocks delayed the growth returns  Balance sheets strengthened in the financialsector; the corporate sector deleveraged byabout 30 percentage points (Non-financialprivate sector debt to GDP ratio) Once shocks faded away, structural reforms • Emphasis on macro-economic stability whilepaid growth dividends from 2003 onwards dealing with global shocks26 Refer Paragraph 6 of this chapter for details India's Medium-Term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope 39Growth Magnets in this decade (2023-2030)India is prepared to grow at its potential once the one-off shocks recede2.35 After a long period of balance sheet repair in the financial and corporate sector, the financialcycle is poised to turn upward. As the health and economic shocks of the pandemic and the spikein commodity prices in 2022 wear off, the Indian economy is thus well placed to grow at itspotential in the coming decade, similar to the growth experience of the economy after 2003.This is the primary reason for expecting India’s growth outlook to be better than it wasin the pre-pandemic years. The sound and healthy financial system developed over the lastfew years will ensure efficient credit provisioning, contributing to higher growth in the comingyears through higher investments and consumption. Thanks to India’s digital revolution andformalisation, banks have far more information about their customer’s credit risks than before,thus being able to make credit and pricing decisions better than before. That should make fora healthier and longer credit cycle than before. Bank credit growth has been well into double-digits for quite some time now. A recent IMF Working paper27 analyses the trends in the Credit-to-GDP ratio gap28, bank balance sheets and the GDP growth in India since 2012; and shows thatbetter-capitalised banks result in higher credit growth, which further translates into higher GDPgrowth.2.36 The digitalisation reforms and the resulting efficiency gains in terms of greaterformalisation, higher financial inclusion, and more economic opportunities will be the secondmost important driver of India’s economic growth in the medium term. In its recent Article IVreport for India, IMF highlighted that India’s successful implementation of the wide-rangingreforms and more than expected dividends from digitalisation could increase India’s medium-term growth potential. 29 These productivity-enhancing reforms along with the Government'sSkilling initiatives, will also help unleash the benefits of the demographic dividend in the comingyears. In sum, various initiatives undertaken in the last eight years have bolstered India’s growthpotential, and it will be reflected in actual GDP growth as the effects of one-off the shocks recede.2.37 The evolving geo-political situation also presents an opportunity for India to benefit fromthe diversification of global supply chains. The last few years have exposed multinational firmsto unprecedented risks due to global trade tensions, pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions,and the conflict in Europe. Firms were exposed to the risk of concentrating their productionin a single country. Therefore, given the global policy uncertainty, multinational firms aregradually exploring strategies to diversify their production bases and supply chains. UNCTAD,in one of its reports, shows that ‘reshoring, diversification, and regionalisation will drive therestructuring of global value chains in the coming years’.30 With enabling policy frameworks,India presents itself as a credible destination for capital diversifying out of other countries.31 3227 IMF Working paper (WP/22/137)- Financial Sector and Economic Growth in India by Margaux MacDonald;TengTeng Xu (July 2022) –(https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/08/Financial-Sector-and-Economic-Growth-in-India-520580)28 Difference between actual ratio and its trend value29 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2022/12/21/India-2022-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-State-ment-by-the-52728330 UNCTAD World Investment report 2020 (https://unctad.org/news/covid-19-will-likely-transform-global-production-says-un-report;https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/wir2020_en.pdf)31 ‘Helped by PLI scheme, Apple’s India exports set to hit Rs 20,000 crore’, Business Standard, December 2022 (https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/helped-by-pli-scheme-apple-s-iphone-exports-from-india-hit-record-122121200940_1.html)32 ‘ India to get more Apple suppliers as iPhone production picks up: Experts’, Business Standard, December 2022 (https://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/india-to-get-more-apple-suppliers-as-iphone-production-picks-up-experts-122121900505_1.html) 40 Economic Survey 2022-23The recently published Chief Economists Outlook 2023 (World Economic Forum) highlightsIndia’s opportunity to gain from these global trends of supply chain diversification.332.38 While the new age reforms undertaken over the last eight years form the foundation ofa resilient, partnership-based governance ecosystem and restore the ability of the economy togrow healthily, further reforms are needed to ensure that economic growth can both accelerateand be sustained at higher levels, to deliver a better quality of life. The deregulation andsimplification of compliances should continue to dismantle the licensing, inspection andcompliance regime entirely. State governments have to address power sector issues, and thefinancial viability concerns of the Discoms have to be addressed. Impetus must be given toeducation and skilling to match the requirements of modern industry and technologies, dealwith twenty-first-century challenges such as climate change and energy transition, and make themost of India’s demographic dividend. Initiatives to sensitise the population towards a healthylifestyle should be continued. Strategies to arrest and reverse the rising obesity levels should beadopted.34 Long-range plans need to be formulated to secure the necessary metals and mineralsrequired for energy transition and diversification. Determined efforts should be taken to makethe public sector asset monetisation scheme successful in realising wide-ranging efficiency gainsfrom the programme. If asset monetisation revenues are used to reduce public sector debt, thesovereign credit rating will improve, leading to a lower cost of capital. That will be the biggestfiscal stimulus to the economy. Reforms to reduce the compliance burden on MSMEs, enhancetheir access to finance and working capital and equip them with skills, knowledge and attitudeto grow their businesses responsibly must continue. State governments should make conclusiveprogress on the various factor market reforms in different stages of completion.2.39 In this chapter, we have shown that the Indian economy had not lost its vigour, nor havegovernment reform measures their effectiveness. The Indian economy could have grown fasterin the absence of the financial and corporate sector balance sheet stress. Even as we were lookingforward to the economy being able to reap the benefits of improved and healthier balance sheetsin the new decade, it was buffeted by the global pandemic followed by a sharp rise in the pricesof food, fuel and fertiliser. Negative shocks will and do fade, as they did in the early years of thenew millennium. Now, financial and corporate sector balance sheets are in good shape, and thereis a willingness to borrow and lend. Hence, it is inevitable that the effects of these reforms willnow shine through. A restored credit cycle will rejuvenate the Indian private sector capex cycle.That alone is adequate to enable India to grow at least 6 per cent per annum in real terms. On topof that, the higher economic efficiency resulting from the public digital infrastructure createdover the last 6-7 years will also add 30- 50 basis points to the potential GDP growth. The growtheffects of the maturation of India’s public digital infrastructure are insufficiently understood.Formalisation and financial inclusion that it has enabled are too evident to be ignored. It isa matter of time before its growth effects become persistent in the data. That is why we areoptimistic that India will achieve an average of 6.5 per cent real GDP growth in the mediumterm. In addition, if the other reforms explained in the previous paragraph are pursued in thecoming years, India’s potential GDP growth can rise to 7-8 per cent per annum in the mediumterm.33 Chief Economists Outlook 2023 (World economic Forum)- https://www.weforum.org/reports/chief-economists-outlook-jan-202334 As per National Family Health Survey 5, Obesity is rising for both men and women across all states . 03Fiscal Developments:CHAPTERRevenue RelishThe Union Budget for FY23 was presented in an uncertain macroeconomic environment.Soon after its presentation, the geopolitical conflict aggravated global supply disruptionsand adversely impacted the prices of fuel, food, and other essential commodities. TheGovernment of India's fiscal policy response to the crisis comprised of a judicious mixof increasing food and fertiliser subsidies on the one hand and a reduction in taxes onfuel and certain imported products on the other. Despite these additional fiscal pressuresduring the year, the Union Government is on track to achieve the budget estimate for thefiscal deficit in FY23. The resilience in the fiscal performance of the Union Governmenthas been facilitated by the recovery in economic activity, buoyancy in revenues fromdirect taxes and GST, and realistic assumptions in the Budget. The Gross Tax Revenueregistered a YoY growth of 15.5 per cent from April to November 2022, driven by robustgrowth in the direct taxes and Goods and Services Tax (GST). The growth in direct taxesduring the first eight months of the year was much higher than their correspondinglonger-term averages. The GST has stabilised as a vital revenue source for central andstate governments, with the gross GST collections increasing at 24.8 per cent on YoY basisduring April - December 2022.On the expenditure side, the Union Government's emphasis on capital expenditure(Capex) has continued despite higher revenue expenditure requirements during the year.The Centre's Capex has steadily increased from a long-term average of 1.7 per cent ofGDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5 per cent of GDP in FY22 PA. The Centre has also incentivisedthe State Governments through interest-free loans and enhanced borrowing ceilings toprioritise their spending on Capex. With an emphasis on infrastructure-intensive sectorslike roads and highways, railways, and housing and urban affairs, the increase in Capexhas large-scale positive implications for medium-term growth. This Capex-led growthstrategy will enable India to keep the growth-interest rate differential positive, leading toa sustainable government debt to GDP in the medium run. 42 Economic Survey 2022-23introduction3.1 With the continuing global risks and uncertainties, the availability of fiscal space withgovernments has become paramount. It is especially true following the recent incidence of thepandemic when the fiscal policy became an effective macroeconomic stabilisation tool globally.In India, particularly when all economic activities had reached a standstill, fiscal policy wasinstrumental in providing a safety net to the vulnerable, reviving the economy by boostingdemand, and addressing certain domestic supply-side constraints through public investmentsand sustained structural reforms.3.2 The large, frontloaded packages across the countries led to over-stimulation of demand,leading to its much faster recovery. In combination with the still-existing supply disruptions andconstraints, the overheating of the economy led to inflationary pressures. The conflict in Europeand the related geopolitical developments aggravated the crisis. The slowing global growth,rising interest rates, persistently high inflation rates and uncertain global environment have thusposed certain pertinent questions for fiscal-policy experts to motivate the overarching fiscalpolicy strategy. How to evaluate the trade-off between maintaining fiscal support to managethe continuing crisis versus withdrawing fiscal stimulus from the economy to control inflationand regain the lost fiscal space? When to do so and at what pace? While a sudden withdrawalmay have costs for medium-term growth, a slow withdrawal may be inflationary and hence putupward pressure on yields, making the debt costly. Moreover, the financial markets may haveless tolerance for fiscal unorthodoxy in an era of rising interest rates1.3.3 Against this backdrop, the Government of India adopted a calibrated fiscal response to thepandemic and planned to withdraw the fiscal stimulus gradually as it moves along the glide pathoutlined in the Budget FY22. This chapter discusses the government's fiscal strategy amidstuncertain geopolitical developments. The chapter starts with a discussion of the performance ofthe Union Government's finances, followed by an overview of the State finances. It concludeswith a commentary on India's debt profile.Developments in union Government finances3.4 While India entered the pandemic with a stretched fiscal position, the government'sprudent and calibrated fiscal response enabled stable public finances even amidst the presentuncertainties. The fiscal deficit of the Union Government, which reached 9.2 per cent of GDPduring the pandemic year FY21, has moderated to 6.7 per cent of GDP in FY22 PA and isfurther budgeted to reach 6.4 per cent of GDP in FY23 (Figure III.1). This gradual decline inthe Union government's fiscal deficit as a per cent of GDP, in line with the fiscal glide pathenvisioned by the government, is a result of careful fiscal management supported by buoyantrevenue collection over the last two years.1‘Ruchir Sharma’s investor guide to 2023: from peak dollar to better TV’, Financial Times, 6th January 2023 (https://www.ft.com/con-tent/3e040c2c-f7e4-4121-9dfe-7ba5732707f7) Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 43Figure iii.1: trends in union government Figure III.2: Government on track to achievedeficits over the years- On the way to fiscal the Fiscal deficit target for FY23consolidation104.658.946.2Apr- Nov Apr- Nov Apr- Nov(5 year Avg) 2021 2022EBfotnecrepasA10 9.286.7 6.45.764.74 3.5 3.4 3.32.82 1.60.4 0.40FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23PA BEPDGfotnecrePFiscal Deficit Primary DeficitSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA Source: O/o CGAUnion Government on track to achieve the Fiscal deficit target for FY233.5 The Union Budget for FY23 was presented in a recovering yet uncertain macroeconomicenvironment, not anticipating the geopolitical developments that unfolded during the year. As theconflict in Europe broke out early in the year, it aggravated supply disruptions and had an adverseimpact on the prices of fuel, food, and other essential commodities. The government's fiscalpolicy response necessitated additional spending on food and fertiliser subsidies, accompaniedby specific duty cuts to control the pass-through of the high imported prices to the consumers/users. Despite additional fiscal resource pressures during the year, the Union Government iswell on track to achieve the budget estimate for the fiscal deficit in FY23. The fiscal deficit ofthe Union Government at the end of November 2022 stood at 58.9 per cent of the BE, lower thanthe five-year moving average of 104.6 per cent of BE during the same period (Figure III.2).Conservative budget assumptions provide a buffer during global uncertainties.3.6 This resilience in the fiscal performance of the Centre has resulted due to a recovery ineconomic activity, buoyancy in revenues observed during the year, and conservative assumptionsof macroeconomic variables in the Budget. The prudent assumptions in Budget FY23 provided abuffer to the government during global uncertainties. As an illustration, the Gross Tax Revenue(GTR) to the Centre was envisaged to grow at 9.6 per cent in FY23 BE relative to FY22 RE.However, given the higher 'Provisional Actual'  out to be a mere 1.8 per centover FY22 PA. Against this implicit (budgeted) growth, the data of the first eight months of theyear show that GTR has grown at a much higher rate (Table III.1). The annual estimate of GTRfor FY23 is thus expected to overshoot the budget estimates. 44 Economic Survey 2022-23Table: III.1: Stable performance of the Union Government fiscal indicators from April tonovember 2022₹ lakh crore as a per cent of Be YoY growth (per cent)Apr-Nov Apr-Nov Apr-Nov Apr-Nov 5 yr Avg Apr-Nov Apr-NovBE FY232021 2022 2021 2022 Apr-Nov 2021 2022Revenue Receipts 22.04 13.58 14.23 75.9 64.6 12.3 67.1 4.8Gross tax revenue 27.58 15.42 17.81 69.5 64.6 13.9 50.3 15.5Assignment to8.17 4.03 5.51 60.5 67.5 16.6 20.4 36.8StatesTax Revenue (net19.35 11.35 12.25 73.5 63.3 12.9 64.9 7.9to Centre)Non-Tax Revenue 2.70 2.23 1.98 91.8 73.5 13.3 79.5 -11.1Non-Debt Capital0.79 0.21 0.41 11.0 52.3 30.6 14.1 100.4ReceiptsNon-Debt receipts 22.84 13.79 14.65 69.8 64.1 12.2 66.0 6.2Total Expenditure 39.45 20.75 24.43 59.6 61.9 11.4 8.8 17.7Revenue31.95 18.01 19.96 61.5 62.5 11.4 8.2 10.8ExpenditureCapital7.50 2.74 4.47 49.4 59.6 12.9 13.5 63.4ExpenditureRevenue Deficit 9.90 4.43 5.73 38.8 57.8 11.4 -48.1 29.3Fiscal Deficit 16.61 6.96 9.78 46.2 58.9 11.5 -35.3 40.6Primary Deficit 7.21 2.34 4.33 33.5 60.1 13.1 -66.2 85.1Source: Union Budget documents, O/o CGAPerformance of Union Government Non-debt Receipts3.7 The Union government's non-debt receipts comprise revenue receipts (tax and non-tax)and non-debt capital receipts.

This section evaluatesthe performance of the Receipts side of the Union Government's finances.Sustained revenue buoyancy over the last two years3.8 After plummeting during the pandemic-affected year FY21, revenue receipts registeredrobust growth in FY22 PA, both on a YoY basis and to the pre-pandemic year FY20(Annexe 1: Table 3). This revenue revival was attributed to a rebound in the collection of allmajor direct and indirect taxes (except excise duties) in FY22. Last year's revenue buoyancymomentum is continuing into the current year. The Gross Tax Revenue registered a YoY growthof 15.5 per cent from April to November 2022, and the Net Tax Revenue to the Centre after theassignment to states grew by 7.9 per cent on a YoY basis (Table III.1, III.2).

However, that revenues have grown at a pace much higher than thegrowth in GDP is a testimony to the effectiveness of efforts taken by the government to expandthe tax base and enhance tax compliance. Structural reforms like the introduction of GST andthe digitalisation of economic transactions have led to the greater formalisation of the economyand hence expanded the tax net. Other tax administration/policy measures, such as the FacelessAssessment and Appeal, simplification of return filing, assistance to taxpayers in getting familiarwith the systems, generation of e-way bills under the GST system, and information sharingbetween government departments among others, have nudged higher tax compliance throughtechnology and artificial intelligence. Details may be seen in Annexe 2 and 3.Direct taxes propelling the growth in Gross tax revenue3.10 Direct taxes, which broadly constitute half of the Gross Tax Revenue (Figure III.3), haveregistered a YoY growth of 26 per cent from April to November 2022, enabled by corporateand personal income tax growth. The growth rates observed in the major direct taxes during thefirst eight months of FY23 were much higher than their corresponding longer-term averages(Figure III.4). 46 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure III.3: Composition of tax profile of Figure III.4: Growth in Centre's direct taxesUnion Government (FY23 BE) are higher than their corresponding longer-termaverages during the period April to November26.7Customs 23.98% 21.1GSTUED28% 15.512%16.813.9 12.910.3PIT GTR Direct CIT PIT26%taxesCIT26% Avg FY13-FY19 (Apr-Nov) Apr-Nov 2022Source: Union Budget FY23, O/o CGANote: GTR - Gross Tax Revenue, GST - Goods and Services Tax, CIT - Corporation Income Tax, PIT - Taxes onIncome other than Corporation Income Tax.m UED - Union Excise DutiesCustoms and Excise duties act as Flexi-fiscal policy tools3.11 While direct taxes have safeguarded the revenue buoyancy, indirect taxes such as customsand excise duties have acted as flexible policy tools during the fiscal response to the pandemic.When the collection of direct and indirect taxes was adversely impacted during the pandemicyear FY21, and low global oil prices created some elbow room for raising taxes on petroleum, thegovernment raised the excise duty on petrol and diesel to augment the revenue pool. Subsequently,when other taxes recovered and inflationary pressures built up in the economy, the governmentreduced the excise duty in November 2021 and May 2022 to control the pass-through of the risingglobal oil prices on the consumers. The budget estimate had factored in negative growth of 15 percent on excise collections for FY23. In line with the expectation, the excise duty collection hasdeclined by 20.9 per cent from April to November 2022 on a YoY basis.3.12 Given the rise in prices of essential imported products during FY23, customs duties werebrought down on several items to control the inflation impact on edible oils, pulses, cotton, steel,etc. However, high imports during the current year have led to a 12.4 per cent YoY growth in thecustoms collection from April to November 2022 (Table III.2), which is higher than the averagegrowth during the corresponding period from FY13 to FY19.Stabilising Goods and Services Tax yielding returns3.13 The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has evolved and stabilised as a vital revenue sourcefor central and state governments (may refer Box III.1). Their gross GST collections, takentogether, were ₹13.40 lakh crore from April to December 2022. Thus, implying a YoY growthof 24.8 per cent (Figure III.5). The pick-up in GST collections was consistently spread across allthe months during the current fiscal year, with an average monthly collection of ₹1.5 lakh crore(Figure III.6). The improvement in GST collections has been due to the combined effect of the Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 47rapid economic recovery post-pandemic, the nationwide drive against GST evaders and fakebills along with many systemic changes introduced recently, and various rate rationalisationmeasures undertaken by the GST Council to correct inverted duty structure. Consistent effortshave resulted in a doubling of the GST net, with the number of GST taxpayers increasingfrom nearly 70 lakh in 20172 to more than 1.4 crore in 2022. Apart from directly supportinggovernment revenues, GST has led to better reporting of income, which in turn has positiveexternalities for income tax collection and economic activity.5037.74030 24.82010 4.3-14.10-10-202019 2020 2021 2022tnecrePFigure III.5: High YoY growth incumulative Gross Gst collectionsfrom april to December1.820221.61.41.2 20211.020200.80.60.40.20.0Source: Department of RevenueerorchkalsRnaJ beF raM rpA yaM nuJ luJ guA peS tcO voN ceDFigure iii.6: continued momentum inmonthly Gross GST collectionsover the yearsSource: Department of RevenueBox III.1: Maturing system of indirect tax collectionsHas the shift to GST improved or worsened the buoyancy of India's indirect tax system? This boxattempts an analysis to shed light on this question.The aggregate State and Central taxes subsumed in the GST exhibited a CAGR of 11.53 per cent inthe pre-GST period (FY13 to FY17). The nominal GDP grew at a CAGR of 11.54 per cent during thisperiod (see items 1 to 7 of Table 1A). Since the growth of the subsumed taxes was marginally less thanthe growth of GDP, the buoyancy was just below one and could be taken as one for practical purposes.The post-GST period experienced many headwinds, most notably the exogenous shock of the Covidpandemic. The nominal GDP grew at a slower CAGR of 9.6 per cent in the post-GST years (FY19 toFY23). However, GST collections have grown at a CAGR of 10.9 per cent (see items 8 to 10 of Table1B), implying aggregate GST collections buoyancy of around 1.1. This has occurred even thoughthe effective GST rate has fallen from inception (from 14.4 per cent in 2017 to 11.6 per cent in 2019,according to RBI).2PMEAC Report- ‘GST-Connecting the remaining dots’, June 2022 48 Economic Survey 2022-23Improved tax collection efficiency was one of the main arguments in favour of GST. The evidenceso far suggests that GST is indeed showing a higher buoyancy than the pre-GST system. This augurswell for future resource mobilisation in the economy.Comparing the performance of All taxes subsumed in GST (Pre vs post-GST period)table 1a: pre Gst periodCAGR (FY17FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17over FY13)₹ lakh croreState taxes subsumed in GST1.

Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 49Centre on track to meet Non-Tax Revenue targets3.14 The non-tax revenue to the Centre mainly includes interest receipts on loans to States andUnion Territories, dividends and profits from Public Sector Enterprises and the Reserve Bankof India, and external grants and receipts for services the Union Government provides. BudgetFY23 envisaged a lower collection of non-tax revenue receipts during the current year relativeto FY22 (around 22.5 per cent lower than FY22 PA) (Table III.3). Of the budgeted amount, 73.5per cent has been collected up to November 2022.Table III.3: Trends in Non-tax Revenue of Union GovernmentApr-NovFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BE2022₹ lakh croreInterest receipts 0.14 0.12 0.12 0.17 0.22 0.18 0.17Dividends & Profits 0.91 1.13 1.86 0.97 1.61 1.14 0.68External Grants 0.04 0.01 0.00 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01Others 0.84 1.07 1.27 0.90 1.64 1.34 1.12Non-tax Revenue 1.93 2.36 3.27 2.08 3.48 2.70 1.98Source: Union Budget documents, O/o CGACommitted towards disinvestment but dependent on external factors3.15 Apart from the tax and non-tax revenue of the Union Government, non-debt capitalreceipts, which comprise recovery of loans and advances, and disinvestment receipts, haveevolved as an important component of the non-debt receipts for the Union Government. DuringFY15 to FY23 (as of 18 January 2023), an amount of about ₹4.07 lakh crore has been realisedas proceeds from disinvestment through 154 transactions using various modes/instruments.This includes ₹3.02 lakh crore realised from minority stake sale and ₹69,412 crore3 realisedfrom strategic disinvestment transactions (in 10 CPSEs - HPCL, REC, DCIL, HSCC, NPCC.NEEPCO, THDC, Kamrajar Port, Air India and NINL).3.16 The pandemic-induced uncertainty, the geopolitical conflict, and the associated risks haveposed challenges before the plans and prospects of the government's disinvestment transactionsover the last three years. Nevertheless, the government has reaffirmed its commitment towardsprivatisation and strategic disinvestment of Public Sector Enterprises by implementing the NewPublic Sector Enterprise Policy and Asset Monetisation Strategy. Out of the budgeted amountof ₹65,000 crore for FY23, 48 per cent has been collected as of 18 January 2023.Performance of Union Government ExpenditurePragmatic expenditure policy of re-prioritisation3.17 Last few years have underlined the importance of countercyclical fiscal policy measuresto support the economy during a crisis. The pandemic mandated additional expenditurerequirements during FY21. The total expenditure of the Union Government in FY21 rose to3This amount does not include Rs. 12,100 cr received as Enterprise Value for NINL transaction as Government of India didn’t have any directequity in this Joint Venture of Central and State PSEs. 50 Economic Survey 2022-2317.7 per cent of GDP, higher than the previous 5-year average of 12.8 per cent of GDP (Annexe1: Table 2). The government adopted a pragmatic approach of increasing its expenditure ina calibrated way. Upon ensuring the basic safety nets for the vulnerable, the emphasis of theGovernment expenditure shifted to productive domestic capital expenditure. In the subsequentyear, FY22, the total Union Government expenditure was brought down to 16 per cent of GDP(PA), and a more significant proportion of this accrued to capital expenditure (Figure III.8). Thecapital expenditure by the Centre has steadily increased from a long-term average of 1.7 per centof GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5 per cent of GDP in FY22 PA. It is further budgeted to increaseto 2.9 per cent of GDP in FY23. (Figure III.7). This highlights an improvement in the quality ofGovernment expenditure over the years.Figure III.7: Increasing Union Government capital expenditure to GDP ratio3.0% 2.9%2.5%2.5%2.2%2.0%1.5%1.0%FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23BESource: Previous Economic Surveys, Union Budget documents, O/o CGAFigure III.8: Rising share of Capital Figure III.9: High growth in capital expenditureExpenditure in Total Expenditure of the Union of the Union Government during the April-Government november period63.4%19.0%15.6%29.3%13.3%11.7% 12.8% 13.5%12.3% 12.5%12.1% 4.0%FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23PA BESource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA Source: O/o CGA Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 51Capex-led growth to bring back animal spirits and manage debt levels3.18 In absolute terms, the Government of India had budgeted an unprecedented ₹7.5 lakhcrore of Capital Expenditure for FY23, of which more than 59.6 per cent has been spent fromApril to November 2022. During this period, capital expenditure registered a YoY growth ofover 60 per cent, much higher than the long-term average growth of 13.5 per cent recorded inthe corresponding period from FY16 to FY20 (Figure III.9).3.19 The Government's thrust on Capital expenditure, particularly in the infrastructure-intensivesectors like roads and highways, railways, and housing and urban affairs, has longer-termimplications for growth (Table III.4). While on the one hand, capital expenditure strengthensaggregate demand and crowds-in private spending in times of risk aversion; it also enhancesthe longer-term supply-side productive capacity. With early signs of a rebound in private sectorinvestments in recent months, capital expenditure has played its role (details in chapter 1).To push for enhancing Capex from all directions, the Centre announced several incentives toboost states' capital expenditure in the form of long-term interest-free loans and capex-linkedadditional borrowing provisions.Table III.4: Centre's Capital expenditure focussed on infra-related sectorsBE FY23 April-Nov 2022 April-Nov 2021 YoY growth₹ lakh crore (Per cent)Road Transport and Highways 1.88 1.49* 0.74 102.10Railways 1.37 1.15 0.65 76.65Defence Services (capital outlay) 1.52 0.73 0.73 0.88Transfer to States 1.12 0.43 0.08 438.54Telecommunications 0.54 0.25 0.03 692.43Housing and Urban Affairs 0.27 0.11 0.17 -32.47Atomic Energy 0.14 0.09 0.06 47.50Defence (Civil) 0.08 0.05 0.04 22.13Police 0.11 0.05 0.03 53.22Space 0.07 0.02 0.04 -48.74Health and Family Welfare 0.06 0.01 0.02 -16.33Note: * of which ₹1.44 lakh crore is on account of Inter Account Transfer to Reserve Funds from the CapitalSection.Source: Union Budget documents, O/o CGAGeopolitical developments stretched the Revenue Expenditure requirements3.20 The significant components of the Centre's revenue expenditure include Interest payments,major subsidies, salaries of Government employees, pensions, defence revenue expenditure,and transfers to States (Table III.5). A substantial portion of the Centre's revenue expenditureis committed and allows limited flexibility in creating additional fiscal headroom if required.However, re-prioritising expenditure and rationalising subsidies are essential tools to stimulateaggregate demand and fulfil redistributive imperatives. 52 Economic Survey 2022-23Table III.5: Major Items of Revenue Expenditure by Union Governmentitems FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA* FY23 BE(in ₹ Lakh crore)Revenue Expenditure of which 18.79 20.07 23.51 30.84 32.01 31.95a.

This contraction was led by a reduction ofthe subsidy expenditure as the economy recovered from the pandemic. The subsidy expenditurewas brought down from 3.6 per cent of GDP in FY21 to 1.9 per cent of GDP in FY22 PA. It wasfurther budgeted to reduce to 1.2 per cent of GDP in FY23.3.22 Due to the sudden outbreak of geopolitical conflict resulting in higher internationalprices for food, fertiliser and fuel, there was a higher food and fertiliser subsidy requirementfor supporting the people and ensuring macroeconomic stability. Around 94.7 per cent of thebudgeted expenditure on subsidies has been utilised from April to November 2022. In the firstbatch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for FY23, the Union Government has sought anadditional ₹80,000 crore for the expenditure towards food subsidy and additional allocationunder Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) and ₹1.09 lakh crore for fertilisersubsidy required during the year. As a result, the revenue expenditure from April to November2022 has grown by over 10 per cent on a YoY basis, higher than the growth noted in thecorresponding period last year (Table III.1).3.23 Another major component of revenue expenditure, interest payments, had maintained astable ratio of non-debt receipts and revenue expenditure during the pre-pandemic years (FigureIII.10). Higher resource requirements and lower revenue collections during the pandemicresulted in higher borrowings by the Union Government. Interest payments as a proportion ofreceipts went up after the pandemic outbreak. However, in the medium term, as we move alongthe fiscal glide path, buoyancy in revenues, aggressive asset monetisation, efficiency gains, andprivatisation would help pay down the public debt, thus bringing down interest payments andreleasing more monies for other priorities.

Thus, it is expected that reaching the budgetestimate for the fiscal deficit during FY23 will not be a concern for the Union Government. Withresilient economic growth, continued revenue buoyancy, and careful expenditure managementover the medium run, the Union Government will be on track with the fiscal path outlinedby the Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Statement. Moreover, the budgetary reforms introducedby the Union Government in the last few years will support attaining the fiscal policy targets(Box III.2).Box III.2: Major reforms in the Union budget over the last few yearsA transparent, comprehensive and realistic budgetary process enables better fiscal management.4This section discusses some of the major governance reforms introduced in the Union Budget overthe last few years that have resulted in greater efficiency in public spending.1. Improved fiscal transparency and realistic revenue assumptions in the BudgetThe Union Government has accorded the highest priority to improving transparency in its financialstatements and accounts by bringing below-the-line expenditures above the line. The Extra-Budgetaryborrowings of the Union Government were brought down from ₹1.48 lakh crore in FY20 and ₹1.21lakh crore in FY21 to ₹750 crore in FY22 (RE). No Extra Budgetary Resources were estimated forFY23 in the Budget.4Section 3- Budget preparation - Guidelines for Public Expenditure Management (IMF, 1999)- https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/expend/guide3.htm 54 Economic Survey 2022-23In addition to cleaner fiscal accounting, Budget 2022 based its revenue projections on realisticassumptions, thus providing a buffer to the government in an uncertain global environment. Thesemeasures credibly demonstrate the government's commitment to sound fiscal management andprovide an adequate buffer to deal with global challenges.2. Discontinuation of Plan-Non plan classification5The Budget FY18 discontinued having Plan and Non-Plan classifications of Government expenditure.The reform gave a greater emphasis to the Revenue and Capital classification of Governmentexpenditure. Over the years, a broad understanding had been that Plan expenditures were good andNon-Plan expenditures were bad, resulting in skewed allocations in the Budget. The reform enabledeffective planning and allocation of resources in the Budget.3. Merger of railway Budget with the Main Budget6The railway budget was merged with the Union Budget from FY18. The reform gave a holisticpicture of the government's financial position. The initiative envisaged facilitating multimodaltransport planning between highways, railways and inland waterways, which has been strengthenedin the subsequent years through Gatishakti.The reform has helped to enhance the efficiency of resources for both Railways and the UnionGovernment. While the merger has exempted Railways from paying dividends to the GovernmentRevenues, it allows the Ministry of Finance to have a greater elbow room at the mid-year reviewfor better allocation of resources. It has also enabled the Ministry of Finance to ensure a coherentemphasis on capital expenditure across sectors in recent years.4. Shifting the date of the Budget to 1 FebruaryThe date of the Budget was advanced to 1 February from the Budget FY18. The advancement ofBudget presentation by a month has paved the way for early completion of the Budget cycle. It hasalso enabled the Ministries to ensure better planning and execution of schemes from the beginningof the financial year.Overview of State Government Financesperformance of state finances3.25 State Governments improved their finances in FY22 after being adversely impacted by thepandemic in FY21. The combined Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD) of the States, which increasedto 4.1 per cent of GDP in the pandemic-affected year, was brought down to 2.8 per cent inFY22 PA. Given the geopolitical uncertainties, the consolidated GFD-GDP ratio for States hasbeen budgeted 3.4 per cent in FY23 (Figure III.11). However, the States' monthly fiscal Accountsdata released by O/o CAG shows that from April- November 2022, the combined borrowingsof the 27 major states have just reached 33.5 per cent of their total budgeted borrowings for theyear.

This growth is a continuation of the buoyancy momentum observedin the FY22 RE. On the expenditure side, revenue and capital expenditures in FY22 BE wereenvisaged to grow at 10.4 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively, over FY22 RE. The RBIStudy on State Finances highlights that the Capital outlay, a part of the capital expenditure, hasrecorded a higher growth in Provisional Actuals than that estimated in the Revised estimates.The capital outlay of States grew by 31.7 per cent in FY22 PA. This increase is attributable tostrong revenue buoyancy and the support provided by the Centre in terms of advance releasesof payments to the states, GST compensation payments, and interest-free loans. The Centre'sinitiatives to support State finances are discussed in the forthcoming sections.Cooperative fiscal federalism drives a well-targeted fiscal policyTransfer from Centre to States3.28 Transfer of funds to the States comprises the share of States in Union taxes devolved to theStates, Finance Commission Grants, Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), and other transfers.Total transfers to States have risen between FY19 and FY23 BE (refer to Table III.6). 56 Economic Survey 2022-23Table III.6: Details of transfers from Centre to States (other than devolution to States)FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 RE FY23 BE(in ₹ lakh crore)Centrally Sponsored Schemes 3.0 3.1 3.8 4.2 4.4Finance Commission Grants 0.9 1.2 1.8 2.1 1.9Other Grants/Loans/Transfers 0.9 2.0 1.9 2.3 3.0Source: Union budget documents3.29 The Finance Commission had recommended allocation of an amounting to ₹1.92 lakhcrore for FY23 in respect of post-devolution revenue deficit grants, grants to local bodies, healthsector grants, and disaster management grants under Article 275 of the Constitution.

To meet the shortfall in GSTcompensation for States, the Government, in addition to the release of regular GST compensationfrom the Fund, borrowed ₹ 2.69 lakh crore during FY21 and FY22 and passed it on to States ona back-to-back basis. Moreover, the cess payments and tax devolution instalments to the Stateswere frontloaded to give them early access to funds. During FY23, the Government of Indiareleased ₹1.16 lakh crore towards the total GST compensation payable to States up to 30 June2022 (as of 25 November 2022). Even though the total Cess collection until November 2022was insufficient to make this entire payment to the States, the Centre released the balance fromits resources. Box III.3 discusses the impact of GST on the flow of resources to the states.Box III.3: GST and the flow of resources to statesThe last five years of experience with GST have seen several rounds of policy debates around raterationalisation, simplification of return filing, compensation cess levies on products, compensationpayments to states etc. One pertinent question that has not been carefully studied is the impact of GSTon the flow of resources to the states. While comparing the total fiscal resources accruing to States Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 57in the pre and post-GST regimes, it is essential to measure the relative performance of taxes vis-à-visthe performance of the economy. In the pre-GST regime, when the economy grew at 11.5 per centnominally, the total fiscal resources accruing to States from the Central and state taxes subsumed inGST (including devolution) grew at 11.1 per cent. It implied a buoyancy of 0.97 (See table 3A).Table 3A- Pre-GST period - Total fiscal resources to States from taxes subsumed in GST(including devolution)CAGR (FY17FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17over FY13)₹ lakh croreState taxes subsumed in GSTStates taxes subsumed in GST 3.22 3.48 3.73 4.41 4.41Central taxes subsumed in GST 1.66 1.90 2.02 2.48 3.14Devolution factor 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.42 0.42Total fiscal resources to States3.75 4.08 4.38 5.46 5.73 11.1%from taxes subsumed in GSTNominal GDP 99.44 112.34 124.68 137.72 153.92 11.5%Pre-GST buoyancy of revenuefrom taxes subsumed in GST 0.97accruing to statesIn the post-GST period, total fiscal resources accruing to the states from the GST (includingdevolution from the Centre's GST) exhibited a buoyancy greater than that in the pre-GSTperiod (Table 3B). This performance is especially noteworthy, considering the reduction ofthe effective weighted average GST rate from 14.4 per cent at the time of inception to 11.6per cent in 2019 (RBI).Table 3B- Post-GST period - Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system (includingdevolution)CAGR (FY23FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*over FY19)₹ lakh croreCGST collections 2.02 2.27 2.10 2.69 3.14SGST collections 2.79 3.09 2.73 3.44 3.98IGST collections 5.99 5.87 5.66 7.62 9.40GST compensation paid for the0.85 1.66 1.68 0.69 0.35yearBack-to-back loans 1.10 1.59 58 Economic Survey 2022-23CAGR (FY23FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*over FY19)Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system*(1) SGST + IGST for states +7.89 8.21 7.61 9.96 11.95 10.9%Devolution from Centre’s GST(2) SGST + IGST for states +Devolution from Centre’s GST 8.74 9.87 9.29 10.65 12.30 8.9%+ Compensation(3) SGST + IGST for states +Devolution from Centre’s GST 8.74 9.87 10.39 12.24 12.30 8.9%+ Compensation + loansIndia Nominal GDP 189.00 200.75 198.01 236.65 273.09 9.6%Post-GST buoyancy of GSTrevenues accruing to states1.13(excluding compensation/loans)Note: (a) The devolution factor is taken as 0.32 from FY13 to FY15; 0.42 from FY16 to FY20; and 0.41 from FY21onwards, as per the recommendation of the respective Finance Commission.(b) IGST for States is taken as 50% of total IGST collection. State's share in Centre's GST is arrived by multiplyingthe devolution factor with CGST and Centre's IGST share.(c) The collection for FY23 have been extrapolated based on the average collections from May to Dec 2022.(d) The GST collections used are gross collections, including domestic supplies and import. However, with only theGST collections through domestic supplies, the post GST buoyancy is still greater than 1 (=1.05).In addition to the regular stream of revenues from GST, a compensation was also provided to thestates in the post-GST period. Since GST was a new tax regime, the compensation scheme wasdesigned to safeguard the states for any difference in the new versus the old tax regime by ensuringsteady revenue growth of 14 per cent per annum for five years. The compensation arrangement wasalso meant to help states ride out the differences in the inter-state distribution of GST. It is pertinentto note here that the compensation system was not envisaged as a buffer to the state's revenues in theeventuality of a fall in tax revenues resulting from a collapse in economic growth.Nevertheless, the incidence of the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of GST Compensation asa buffer to the States' revenues. During FY21, revenues for Centre and states were adversely affecteddue to the economic contraction. The compensation requirement by the states increased substantiallyamidst a decline in the CGST and the compensation cess collections. Despite having limited fiscalresources in the middle of a crisis, the Centre borrowed funds and passed them on to States on a back-to-back loan basis, in addition to the release of regular GST compensation. These loans will be repaidfrom future inflows into the GST Compensation Cess Fund and hence are not a burden on the states.

Thus, comparing the growth in aggregate SGST(item 1 in the table) is a better measure to gauge the performance of SGST revenues of the States.(c) The above analysis includes SGST and IGST collections from both domestic supplies and imports. However, if wetake the collections on domestic supplies, growth in item 1 of the table is 26.5 per cent in FY22 and 17.3 per cent inFY23.We see from the above analysis that the GST regime and its implementation mechanism have notonly safeguarded the States' revenues from the initial teething troubles of a new tax system but alsoprotected the States' finances amidst unprecedented external shocks during the last five years. In theabsence of GST, Indian states would have had no recourse to compensation, nor could they havecontemplated augmenting their revenues through fresh and/or higher levies during a pandemic.Sources: Department of Revenue, RBI, Union budgets, MoSPI, PIB releasesEnhanced limit of borrowing for the States and incentives for reforms3.31 Since the pandemic outbreak, the Centre has kept the Net borrowing Ceiling of the StateGovernments above the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL) threshold. It was fixed at 5 percent of GSDP in FY21, 4 per cent of GSDP in FY22 and 3.5 per cent of GSDP in FY23. A part ofthis additional borrowing was linked to reforms encouraging the States to undertake them. Forinstance, in FY21, a part of the additional borrowing ceiling was conditional on implementingthe 'One Nation One Ration Card' System, ease of doing business reform, urban Local body/utility reforms, and power sector reforms. As a result, 17 States implemented the One NationOne Ration Card System, 20 States completed the stipulated reforms in the Ease of DoingBusiness, 11 States had done local body reforms and 17 States carried out fully/partly PowerSector Reforms. Similarly, a part of the additional borrowing was earmarked for incrementalcapital expenditure to be incurred by States during FY22. Sixteen states accessed the additionalborrowings upon meeting the Capex target. 60 Economic Survey 2022-233.32 In addition to the net borrowing ceilings fixed for the States, Fifteenth Finance Commissionhad recommended performance-based additional borrowing space of 0.50 per cent of GrossState Domestic Product (GSDP) to the States in the power sector. This special dispensation hasbeen recommended for each year for four years, from FY22 to 2024-25. For the financial yearFY22, additional borrowing permission of ₹39,175 crore was allowed to 12 States for meetingthe stipulated reform criteria.Centre's support towards States' capital expenditure3.33 The Union government has provided 50-year interest-free loans to state governmentsunder the 'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment' for the last threeyears. Amounts of ₹11,830 crore and ₹14,186 crore were provided to states in FY21 and FY22.A part of the allocation for FY22 was earmarked for providing incentives to the States forprivatisation/disinvestment of the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and monetisation/recycling of assets. During the year FY23, the allocation under the Scheme has been raisedto ₹1.05 lakh crore to give further impetus to State Capex plans. This amount includes anunconditional component and smaller components linked to specific reforms/initiatives (TableIII.8). Notably, if state governments were allowed this ₹1 lakh crore as an additional borrowinglimit, they would bear an interest rate higher than the rate at which the Union governmentborrows. Further, they may use it for revenue expenditure. This interest-free loan in the presentarrangement is dedicated only to capital expenditure.Table III.8: Details of Scheme for Special Assistance to States for CapitalInvestment' for FY23component Basis allocated approved Released(₹ crore)Allocation proportional to the share of tax1 80000 68,592 31,571devolution for FY23II PM Gati Shakti-related expenditure 5,000 1,458 1,458III PMGSY 4,000 1,616 1,616IV Incentive for digitisation 2,000V Optical fiber cable 2,215 2,011VI Urban reforms 6,000VII Disinvestment and monetisation 5,000Source: Department of ExpenditureBox III.4: Initiatives by the State Governments to improve their own resourcesThe pandemic has stretched state finances by expanding the expenditure needs and adversely hittingthe revenues. While the Union Government has supported state governments through the aboveinitiatives, state governments have also taken steps to enhance their resource pool.In its recent report on municipal finances, RBI pointed out that India's property tax collection wasmuch lower than the OECD countries. There is a wide disparity in taxes across the States, thuscreating scope for a large-scale reform of property taxation practices in India. States like Tamil Nadu, Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 61Telangana and Kerala have revised the property taxes in their States during the year to support theirrevenues.7,8Some states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana,Kerala, Assam, and UT of Puducherry have considered revising their power tariffs during FY23. Onthe other hand, Uttar Pradesh has announced a new liquor policy whereby it increased the licensefee, renewal fees, processing fee, and registration fee across various categories of liquor/ distilleries.In addition, many States have also made efforts towards privatising SPSEs and Monetising assets inFY21 & FY22 to receive additional incentives from the Union Government. These reforms will leadto unlocking the money trapped in unproductive assets and freeing it up for productive use.Some other revenue generating measures adopted by the States include Assam's liquidation schemefor payment of arrears, Haryana's one-time scheme for settlement of old VAT dues, and Assam andKerala's Green tax to discourage old vehicles.Sources: Newspaper reports, RBIDebt Profile of the Government3.34 Given the unprecedented fiscal expansion in 2020, rising government liabilities have emergedas a significant concern across the globe. IMF projects9 the global government debt at 91 per cent ofGDP in 2022, about 7.5 percentage points above the pre-pandemic levels. While countries worldwidehad started winding up the fiscal support provided during the pandemic, challenging global financialconditions amidst global uncertainties tightened budget constraints.10 Some European economies areexpanding their budgets to provide relief to households and small businesses from mounting energybills (Figure III.13).

ForIndia, the total liabilities of the Union Government, which were relatively stable as a percentageof GDP over the past decade, witnessed a sharp spike in the pandemic year FY21. This spikein debt resulted from the pandemic-induced higher Government borrowings to finance theadditional expenditure needs, given the strained revenues and sharp contraction in the GDP.Total liabilities of the Union Government moderated from 59.2 per cent of GDP in FY21 to 56.7per cent in FY22 (P) (Figure III.14). A brief description of the major components of the totalliabilities of the Union Government is given in Table III.9.Figure III.14: Moderating Union Government's Debt-GDP ratio after thepandemic induced-spike6559.26055 56.7504540FY04 FY06 FY08 FY10 FY12 FY14 FY16 FY18 FY20 FY22PDGfotneCrePSource: Various Issues of Status Paper on Government DebtNote: The Figures for FY22 are ProvisionalTable III.9: Debt Position of Union Government (in ₹ lakh crore)components FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA1 2 3 4 5 6 7a. public Debt57.11 61.50 68.45 75.49 85.65 105.23 121.21(A1+A2)a1. internal Debt53.05 57.42 64.01 70.75 80.20 99.08 114.62(a+b)a. marketable47.28 50.49 55.10 59.69 65.60 78.59 88.17securitiesb.

FY FY20)Stable debt profile with relatively low currency and interest rate risk3.36 India's public debt profile is relatively stable and is characterised by low currency andinterest rate risks. During his speech at the South Centre in Geneva (April 2018), former RBIGovernor Dr YV Reddy said, 'since most of India's public debt is held by the residents anddenominated in domestic currency. I would, therefore, be less dogmatic on the fiscal deficitand public debt numbers and more emphatic about the context.' Of the Union Government'stotal net liabilities in end-March 2021, 95.1 per cent were denominated in domestic currency,while sovereign external debt constituted 4.9 per cent, implying low currency risk (FigureIII.15). Further, sovereign external debt is entirely from official sources, which insulates it fromvolatility in the international capital markets.Figure III.15: Proportion of external liability inpublic debt (FY22)404.9%3530 29.3 28.825 22.919.02035.015 30.922.91095.1% 5 11.20Internal liability External liability 0-5 5-10 10-20 20 yrsyrs yrs yrs & aboveSource: PDMC, DEAlatotfotnecrePFigure III.16: Elongation of the maturityprofile of outstanding Dated unionGovernment securities2012-132021-22 (P)Source: Various Issues of Status Paper on Government DebtNote: The Figures for FY22 are Provisional3.37. Public debt in India is primarily contracted at fixed interest rates, with floating internaldebt constituting only 1.7 per cent of GDP in end-March 2021. The debt portfolio is, therefore,insulated from interest rate volatility, which also provides stability to interest payments. Theweighted average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the government hasincreased from 9.7 years in end-March 2010 to 11.71 years in end-March 2022, thus reducing 64 Economic Survey 2022-23the rollover risk in the medium-term (Figure III.16).

The General Government finances give an overview of fiscal position of the Governmentsector as a whole. Figure III.17 shows the trends in General Government debt and deficitsover the past few years. The General Government liabilities as a proportion of GDP increasedsteeply during FY21 on account of the additional borrowings made by Centre and States onaccount of the pandemic. However, the ratio has come off its peak in FY22 (RE). The GeneralGovernment deficits as a per cent of GDP have also consolidated after their peak in F21. TheGeneral Government is expected to follow the path of fiscal consolidation in the medium term.Figure III.17: General Government liabilities to GDP ratio come off their peak attained in FY2118 10089.616 84.5 86.5 9014 13.175.7 801268.5 68.8 69.8 70.810 66.6 9.2 10.3 707.28 9.4 605.563.9 5044.2 4020 30FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 REFY23 BEPDGfotnecrePPDGfotnecrePOutstanding liabilities of General Government (RHS)Gross Fiscal DeficitGross Revenue DeficitSource: RBIA positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the Government Debt sustainable3.39. The emphasis on capex in recent years is expected to boost GDP growth directly, andindirectly through multiplier effects on private consumption expenditure and private investment.Higher GDP growth would thereby facilitate buoyant revenue collection in the medium term, andthereby enable a sustainable fiscal path. The General Government Debt to GDP ratio increasedfrom 75.7 per cent of end-March 2020 to 89.6 per cent at the end of the pandemic year FY21.It is estimated to decline to 84.5 per cent of GDP by end-March 2022. The emphasis on capex-led growth will enable India to keep the growth-interest rate differential positive. As shown inFigure III.18 below, this differential has historically been positive for India. A positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the debt levels sustainable. Box III.5 shows that steady economicgrowth will accelerate fiscal consolidation in the economy. Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 65Figure III.18: Growth-interest rate differential for IndiaSource: RBI, IMF3.40. A comparison of the change in General Government debt to GDP ratio from 2005 to 2021across the countries highlights a substantial increase for most countries. For India, this increaseis modest, from 81 per cent of GDP in 2005 to around 84 per cent of GDP in 2021 (FigureIII.19). It has been possible on the back of resilient economic growth during the last 15 yearsleading to a positive growth-interest rate differential, which, in turn, has resulted in sustainableGovernment debt to GDP levels.Figure III.19: Comparing General Government debt to GDP ratio in 2005 with 2021across the countries174% 263%66% 128%39% 95%67% 113%26% 72%30% 69%69% 93%81% 84%68% 70% 200541% 43%2021Source: World Economic Outlook, October 2022. 66 Economic Survey 2022-23Box III.5: Sustained growth as the path to fiscal consolidationThe high fiscal deficit to GDP ratio witnessed in the aftermath of the pandemic is a concern for countriesworldwide. A solution to the increased fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios lies in persistently highgrowth for a few years. A simple counterfactual experiment shows that sustained growth of 10 percent per annum would have resulted in much lower Union Government deficit and debt ratios forIndia in the post-pandemic years, despite keeping the expenditure levels the same.Under Scenario 1, the impact of a higher nominal GDP growth is evaluated on fiscal deficit and debtratios, keeping the revenues and expenditures the same as actual. A counterfactual nominal GDP isestimated, assuming a growth rate of 10 per cent each year from FY20 to FY22. The actual CentralGovernment fiscal deficit as a per cent of the counterfactual GDP is estimated as 4.5 per cent inFY20, 8 per cent in FY21, and 6.3 per cent in FY22, lower than the actual ratios observed (see rows(A) and (E) of Table 5A). Similarly, the ratio of Central Government debt to the estimated GDP isalso lower than the actual debt-GDP ratio (see rows (B) and (F) of Table 5A).Table 5A: Counterfactual Experiment to show sustained growth results inlower deficit and debt ratiosFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 RowActual GDP (₹ lakh crore) 189.0 200.7 198.0 236.6Growth in actual GDP (%) 6.2 -1.4 19.5Assumed growth in GDP (%) 10.0 10.0 10.0Estimated GDP (₹ lakh crore) 207.9 228.7 251.6scenario 1Actual Fiscal Deficit/Estimated GDP (%) 4.5 8.0 6.3 (A)Actual Central Govt Debt/Estimated GDP (%) 50.9 54.8 55.5 (B)scenario 2Assumed revenue buoyancy 0.8 1.6 1.6Estimated revenue collection (₹ lakh crore) 18.1 21.0 24.3Estimated fiscal deficit (₹ lakh crore) 8.8 14.1 13.7Estimated fiscal deficit/ Estimated GDP 4.2 6.2 5.4 (C)scenario 3Assumed revenue buoyancy 0.8 0.9 1.6Estimated revenue collection (₹ lakh crore) 18.1 19.6 22.7Estimated fiscal deficit (₹ lakh crore) 8.8 15.5 15.2Estimated fiscal deficit/ Estimated GDP 4.2 6.8 6.1 (D) Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 67memo itemsActual Expenditure (₹ lakh crore) 23.2 26.9 35.1 37.9Actual Revenues (₹ lakh crore) 16.7 17.5 16.9 22.1Actual Fiscal deficit (₹ lakh crore) 6.5 9.3 18.2 15.9Actual Fiscal Deficit/Actual GDP (%) 4.7 9.2 6.7 (E)Actual Central Govt Debt/Actual GDP (%) 52.7 63.3 59.0 (F)Sources: Newspaper reports, RBIHowever, higher GDP growth rate also impacts the fiscal deficit through higher revenues. Scenario2 of the analysis incorporates the impact of higher GDP growth on the fiscal deficit to GDP ratiothrough the revenue channel. The expenditure levels were retained as actuals in the analysis. Theactual revenue buoyancies for FY20 and FY22 and the budgeted revenue buoyancy for FY21were considered to quantify the impact of higher GDP growth on revenues. The budgeted revenuebuoyancy was taken for FY21 because the actual buoyancy ratio could not be interpreted in the yearof nominal GDP contraction. The fiscal deficit was calculated using the estimated revenues andactual expenditures for respective years. The estimated fiscal deficit as a proportion of GDP came outto be 4.2 for FY20, 6.2 for FY21, and 5.4 for FY22, much lower than the actual observed (see rows(C) and (E) of Table 5A).Further, we see in scenario 3 that by taking the previous 5-year average revenue buoyancy for FY21instead of the budgeted buoyancy and retaining actual revenue buoyancies for FY20 and FY22, thefiscal deficit to GDP ratio is still lower than the actual observed (see rows (D) and (E) of Table 5A).The messages from this counterfactual exercise are simple: even moderate growth, if sustained,will support fiscal consolidation in the medium run and result in sustainable public finances. Two,India's public debt and deficit ratios went up sharply in recent years, not just on account of higherspending and lower tax revenues due to the pandemic but also due to the denominator undershootingtrends resulting from financial system stress, followed by the pandemic. With both out of the way,nominal growth should return to its trend path, and hence, fiscal parameters would begin to showimprovement. There is a need for continued vigilance and adherence to the path of fiscal prudence,but an undue alarm is unwarranted.conclusion3.41. The Government of India has adopted a holistic policy towards fiscal stability in the lastfew years. Using the crisis as an opportunity to bring about reforms, the government undertooka series of policy measures in the previous few years. These policies range from bringing inbudget transparency and using prudent assumptions in the Budget to transforming the taxecosystem by implementing technology, rationalising GST, reducing tax rates, simplifying taxcompliances, and ending the uncertainty around retrospective taxation. All these measures haveled to a greater formalisation of the economy, enhanced compliances and better reporting ofthe income by the public and imparted credibility to the government's commitment to fiscalmanagement. 68 Economic Survey 2022-233.42. The spike in India's debt and deficit ratios has not only been due to higher spendingnecessitated by the pandemic-induced cessation of economic activity but also due to thecontraction or slower growth in the denominator (nominal GDP). In FY20, India's GDP growthslowed down due to the ongoing stress in the financial system. While the banking sector wasundergoing repair and was recapitalising, the non-banking financial sector crisis renewed theuncertainties for the banking system. This kept credit growth muted, leading to slower GDPgrowth.11 The pandemic aggravated the situation in FY21, which caused the nominal GDP tocontract, a rare occurrence in India. A detailed discussion may be seen in Chapter 2.3.43. As India's economic recovery advances, amidst the continuing global uncertainties andrisks, the fiscal glide path illuminates the path for fiscal policy. That will ensure more significantfiscal space for policy action in uncertain times. Further, in reality, fiscal discipline translates intoa fiscal stimulus for all sections of the economy through lower interest rates. As governmentsmake their fiscal situations sustainable and stick to that path, the risk premium embedded intheir interest rates comes down, thus lowering the cost of capital for all sections of society - ontheir educational loans, housing loans, car loans and business loans – and putting more moneyin their hands. For EMDE, the stimulus effect of fiscal deficit, via diminishing risk-premium,is likely greater than it is for advanced economies. That is the reality, as financial markets donot treat advanced and emerging economies similarly on fiscal deficits. Therefore, it stands toreason that they reap greater rewards for fiscal prudence. As stated earlier, this is particularlyrelevant in an era of rising interest rates.3.44. The Centre should continue incentivising the States for reforms and higher capital spendingto ensure a stronger General government. The capex-led growth strategy will ensure sustainabledebt levels in the medium term.11IMF Working paper (WP/22/137)- Financial Sector and Economic Growth in India by Margaux MacDonald ; TengTeng Xu (July 2022) –(https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/08/Financial-Sector-and-Economic-Growth-in-India-520580 ) Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 69annexeAnnexe 1: Data on longer-term trends in Union government financesTable 1: Union Government's Fiscal ParametersFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BEIn ₹ lakh croreRevenue Receipts 14.35 15.53 16.84 16.34 21.68 22.04Gross Tax Revenue 19.19 20.80 20.10 20.27 27.08 27.58Net tax revenue 12.42 13.17 13.57 14.26 18.20 19.35Non-tax revenue 1.93 2.36 3.27 2.08 3.48 2.70Non-debt capital receipts 1.16 1.13 0.69 0.58 0.39 0.79Non-debt receipts 15.51 16.66 17.53 16.92 22.08 22.84Total Expenditure 21.42 23.15 26.86 35.10 37.94 39.45Revenue Expenditure 18.79 20.07 23.51 30.84 32.01 31.95Capital Expenditure 2.63 3.08 3.36 4.26 5.93 7.50Fiscal Deficit 5.91 6.49 9.34 18.18 15.87 16.61Revenue Deficit 4.44 4.54 6.67 14.50 10.33 9.90Primary Deficit 0.62 0.67 3.22 11.38 7.81 7.21Memo ItemGDP at Market Price 170.90 188.87 200.75 198.01 236.65 258.00Source: Union Budget documents, O/o CGATable2: Union Government's Fiscal Parameters (Per cent of GDP)FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BERevenue Receipts 8.4 8.2 8.4 8.3 9.2 8.5Gross Tax Revenue 11.2 11.0 10.0 10.2 11.4 10.7Net tax revenue 7.3 7.0 6.8 7.2 7.7 7.5Non-tax revenue 1.1 1.2 1.6 1.0 1.5 1.0Non-debt capital receipts 0.7 0.6 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.3Non-debt receipts 9.1 8.8 8.7 8.5 9.3 8.9Total Expenditure 12.5 12.3 13.4 17.7 16.0 15.3Revenue Expenditure 11.0 10.6 11.7 15.6 13.5 12.4Capital Expenditure 1.5 1.6 1.7 2.2 2.5 2.9Fiscal Deficit 3.5 3.4 4.7 9.2 6.7 6.4Revenue Deficit 2.6 2.4 3.3 7.3 4.4 3.8Primary Deficit 0.4 0.4 1.6 5.7 3.3 2.8Source: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA 70 Economic Survey 2022-23Table 3: Growth rate of Union Government's Fiscal Indicators ( in per cent)FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BE(1) FY23 BE(2)Revenue Receipts 4.4 8.2 8.4 -3.0 32.7 6.0 1.7Gross Tax Revenue 11.8 8.4 -3.4 0.8 33.6 9.6 1.8Net tax revenue 12.8 6.0 3.0 5.1 27.6 9.6 6.3Non-tax revenue -29.4 22.3 38.8 -36.5 67.6 -14.1 -22.5Non-debt capital receipts 77.0 -2.5 -39.2 -16.0 -32.0 -20.7 102.2Non-debt receipts 7.7 7.4 5.2 -3.5 30.5 4.8 3.4Total Expenditure 8.4 8.1 16.0 30.7 8.1 4.6 4.0Revenue Expenditure 11.1 6.8 17.1 31.2 3.8 0.9 -0.2Capital Expenditure -7.5 16.9 9.1 27.0 39.1 24.5 26.6Fiscal Deficit 10.4 9.9 43.8 94.8 -12.7 4.4 4.7Revenue Deficit 40.2 2.5 46.7 117.5 -28.7 -9.0 -4.1Primary Deficit 13.1 7.5 381.6 254.0 -31.4 -7.3 -7.8Source: Union Budget documents, O/o CGANote: (1) Growth in FY23 BE over FY22 RE (2) Growth in FY23 BE over FY22 PAAnnexe 2: Indirect tax measures by CBIC during 2021-22The reforms initiated by the government in recent years have ensured the development ofa trust-based tax system.

A taxpayer having taxable income up to ₹50 lakh anddisputed income up to ₹10 lakh shall be eligible to approach the Committee. The procedureof the Committee will be conducted electronically to ensure efficiency, transparency andaccountability.● Taking forward the policy of litigation management and to avoid repetitive appeals, a newprovision has been made under the Income-tax Act, 1961, wherein if a question of lawin the case of an assessee is identical to a question of law pending in appeal before thejurisdictional High Court or the Supreme Court in his case or any other case, the filing offurther appeal to the Appellate Tribunal or the jurisdictional High Court in the case of theassessee shall be deferred till such question of law is decided by the relevant Court subjectto certain conditions.Measures undertaken to curb tax evasion & facilitate the widening of the tax base● A formal mechanism of sharing information through the Annual Information Statement(AIS) and e-Verification scheme has recently been enabled. These measures further theaim of widening and deepening the tax base by ensuring authorities possess all relevantfinancial information of an assessee, thus allowing access to such information to a taxpayerfor accurate filing of his return of income.● The Finance Act 2022 has also introduced specific provisions for the taxation of virtualdigital assets (VDA), where the transfer of VDA is to be taxed at the rate of 30% withno deduction in respect of expenditure (other than the cost of acquisition) to be allowed.Moreover, loss from the transfer of virtual digital assets cannot be set off from any otherincome and cannot be carried forward to subsequent years. Further, the transfer of VDA issubject to TDS of 1% of the transaction value (whether in cash/ kind/ both). The gift of VDAwould also be taxed in the hands of the recipient.● Deduction of tax at source on benefit or perquisite in respect of business or professionhas also been introduced in Finance Act 2022 to widen and deepen the tax base. A personproviding any benefit or perquisite to a resident would deduct TDS of 10% of the value oraggregate of the value of such benefit or perquisite (whether in cash/kind/ both).● Finance Act 2022 has provided that no set off of any loss shall be allowed against undisclosedincome detected during search and survey operations to bring certainty and increasedeterrence among tax evaders.● Vide Finance Act 2022, provisions applicable to bonus stripping have also been madeapplicable to securities. It has also been provided that the provisions on bonus stripping anddividend stripping shall also apply to units of an Infrastructure Investment Trust or a RealEstate Investment Trust, or units of Alternative Investment Funds.Tax incentives● Finance Act 2022 has provided income tax relief to the amount received by a taxpayer formedical treatment from an employer or from any person for treatment of Covid-19 duringFY 2019-2020 and subsequent years. Income-tax relief has also been provided to ex-gratia 72 Economic Survey 2022-23payment received from the employer/ other person by family members of a person who hasdied on account of Covid-19 during FY 2019-2020 and subsequent years.● Tax relief has also been widened to the persons with disability. The payment of annuity andlump sum amount from insurance scheme is to be allowed to differently abled dependentduring the lifetime of parents/guardians, i.e., on parents/ guardian attaining the age of 60years or more and where such contribution to the scheme has been discontinued.● To bring parity between employees of State and Central government, the tax deduction limiton employer contribution has been increased from existing 10% to 14% of salary in NPSTier-I Account for State Government employees as well. This would also help in enhancingsocial security benefits.● To promote start-ups, the Income Tax Act of 1961 allows for a deduction of 100% of theprofit and gains of eligible start-ups for three consecutive years out of ten years. However,due to Covid-19, there have been delays in setting up such eligible businesses. To lend asupporting hand to these start-ups, the period of incorporation of the eligible start-up hasbeen extended to 31.03.2023 vide Finance Act 2022.● To provide a level playing field between cooperative societies and companies, the alternateminimum tax rate paid by cooperatives has been reduced from 18.5% to 15%. Further,surcharge on cooperative societies has been reduced from 12% to 7% for those having totalincome of more than ₹1 crore and up to ₹10 crore.● For concessional tax regime to establish a globally competitive environment, the date ofcommencement of manufacturing or production of an article or thing for a newly establishedmanufacturing entity for availing 15% concessional tax rate under section 115BAB of theIncome-tax Act, 1961 has been extended from 31st March 2023 to 31st March 2024.● Over the past few years, several tax concessions have been provided to units located inInternational Financial Services Centre (IFSC) under the Income-tax Act, 1961, to make it aglobal hub of the financial services sector. To further incentivise operations from IFSC, thefollowing have been made exempt from tax subject to specified conditions vide Finance Act,2022:i. Income of a non-resident from offshore derivative instrumentsii. Income from over-the-counter derivatives issued by an offshore banking unitiii. Income from royalty and interest on account of the lease of a shipiv. Income received from portfolio management services in IFSCAnnexe 3: Measures by CBIC undertaken during FY23Reform measures as regards customs:● The Customs duty rate structure has been guided by a conscious policy of the government toincentivise domestic value addition under Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative,which inter alia envisages imposition of lower duty on raw materials and providingreasonable tariff support to goods being manufactured in India. The customs duty structurehas been calibrated to incentivise investment in key areas like petroleum exploration, Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 73electronic manufacturing, etc. In accordance with this policy, the MFN rates of BCD havebeen increased in recent years on such items which are being manufactured in India or whichdomestic industry aspires to manufacture. Accordingly, during the last 6 years, about 4000tariff lines (approximately 1/3rd of total tariff lines) have seen upward calibration of BCD.Such items include, metals, metal products, auto parts, footwear, fabrics, garments, specifiedchemicals, toys, certain machinery, medical equipment, a number of MSME items like bells,gongs, ceramic wares, table ware, utensils, hardware etc, consumer electronics and homeappliances including mobile, TV, refrigerators, washing machine, AC, fans, heaters, hairdryers, shavers, toasters, ovens etc. At the same time, duties of inputs and raw materials havebeen rationalised.● Phased Manufacturing Plan (PMP) in respect of significant products like mobile phones,other electronic goods like TVs, electric vehicles, batteries, solar panel etc- The BCD ratesin respect of different stages of the value chain of these products are calibrated in a mannerthat encourages gradual deepening of domestic value addition. For example, in respect ofmobile phones, initially the parts were placed under nil BCD while duty was imposed onmobiles. Gradually, duty has been raised on parts in phased manner as their productionbegan in India.● India stands fully compliant with all the commitments under WTO's Trade FacilitationAgreement. Compliance has been achieved well within the stipulated timeline of February2022 and the same stands duly notified and acknowledged by the World Trade Organisation.The heartening results achieved can be evidenced from the significant improvements in thestandings in the United Nation's Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation,wherein, India has witnessed a sustained improvement in the Trade Facilitation score to90.32% in 2021 from 78.49% in 2019. India is the best performing country when comparedwith South and South West Asia (63.12%) region.● With the objective to enhance the uniformity in the physical examination process of EXIMcargo and reduce the time and cost involved in the process, CBIC has introduced RiskManagement based uniform cargo examination orders at all Customs locations across thecountry, vide Circular No. 16/2022-Customs dated 29th of August, 2022.● Continuing with the trend to implement measures to facilitate taxpayers, CBIC has notifiedthe Customs (Electronic Cash Ledger), Regulations, 2022 dated 30.03.2022 to enable theimporter, exporter or any person liable to pay Customs duty, fees etc., to deposit an advancewith the government instead of making transaction wise payment as was being done earlier.Such deposit can be utilised for payment of duties and other sums relating to Customs byseamlessly debiting the requisite amount from the ECL. Additionally, CBIC has launchedan Anonymised Escalation Mechanism for handling the grievances related to delay inclearances. In the above mechanism, CBIC's ICEGATE registered users can submit theirgrievance for delayed clearances under faceless assessment and escalate it anonymouslyto the concerned assessing as well as the higher officers at relevant FAG Port (FacelessAssessment Group). The Anonymized Escalation facility also enables users to track thestatus of the grievances submitted by them till the final resolution. 74 Economic Survey 2022-23● With an objective to utilise technology to optimise internal processes, CBIC has launcheda pilot project for implementation of Electronic Cargo Tracking System (ECTS) on14.10.2021, based on blockchain technology for tracking movement of goods from the portto a warehouse at ICD Tughlakabad ensuring secured documentation & GPS based trackingof containers.● Indian Customs has notified IGCRS Rules, 2022 vide Notification 74/2022 dated 9thSeptember, 2022 superseding the existing Customs (Import of Goods at Concessional Rateof Duty) Rules, 2017. These rules have come into effect from 10th September 2022. Theserules have introduced significant changes for simplifying and automating the procedures forimport of goods at concessional Rate of Duty in accordance with the larger goals of "Ease ofdoing business" by accommodating long standing demands from the trade such as inclusionof job work, clearance of capital goods at depreciated value, making the entire processsimple and online and doing away with any need for physical interface with officers.Changes in Customs Law and Procedure:● As a trade facilitation measure, the validity of e-scrips issued under the Electronic DutyCredit Ledger Regulations, 2021, has been increased from one year to two years from thedate of their generation. Further, the recovery provisions from the transferee holder of thee-scrips (issued under RoDTEP and RoSCTL schemes) and suspension of its credit accounthave also been omitted.● In order to leverage the vast network of post offices across the country and enable MSME's(Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) to export to global markets using e-commerce orother regular channels, the CBIC in collaboration with the Department of Posts (Dop) hasnotified the Postal Exports (Electronic Declaration and processing) Regulations, 2022.Under the new system, an exporter need not visit a Foreign post Office (FPO) to file thePostal Bill of Export (PBE) and present export parcel. Rather, he is enabled to file the PBEonline from his home/office and handover the export parcel to postal authorities at a nearbybooking post office. Postal authorities shall arrange secure transport of export parcel frombooking post office to an FPO, where customs clearance shall take place.● Circular No.8/2022-Customs dated 17.5.2022 has been issued to enable exports fromBangladesh to India by rail in closed containers, with clearance at hinterland ICDs. Atransshipment module has also been developed in the Indian Customs EDI system to digitisethe procedure. This would decongest the border trade points and facilitate Bangladesh'sexports.● Vide Circular No. 17/2022-Customs dated 9.9.2022, CBIC has enabled export of containerisedcargo from any inland Container Depot (ICD) to Bangladesh using a combination of rail/road route and riverine route. For instance, the containerised cargo after customs clearanceat an ICD shall be transported to Kolkata/Haldia port by rail or road, from where it shall beloaded on a barge for export to Bangladesh using riverine route. Customs clearance shalltake place at the ICD and only preventive checks are conducted at Kolkata/Haldia. Thisfacility is expected to help reduce congestion of export cargo at land Customs Stations. Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 75● With a view to leveraging the potential of inland Waterways for enhancing trade and transit,CBIC has allowed movement of containerised export goods of Bangladesh through Indiausing a combination of riverine and rail routes. This facility, allowed Vide Circular No.19/2022-Customs dated 14.9.2022, involves entry of containerised cargo on a barge/vesselfrom Bangladesh into India up to the sea port of Kolkata or Haldia using the riverine route.From the sea port of Kolkata or Haldia, the goods will travel by rail to the sea port of NhavaSheva or Mundra for final export to third countries by sea route. The Circular lays downdetailed procedure and documentation and provides for track and trace facility using ECTS(Electronics Cargo Tracking System). This arrangement is expected to save time and cost forthe traders by providing an alternate and more efficient trade route.● Vide Circular No. 09/2022-Customs dated 30.6.2022, CBIC has put in place a simplifiedregulatory framework for e-commerce exports of jewellery via international CourierTerminals (ICTs). To accommodate the e-commerce business need, it incorporates a re-importprocess for return of jewellery. For this purpose, the Courier import and export (ElectronicDeclaration and Processing) Regulations, 2010 have been amended vide NotificationNo. 57/2022-Customs (N.T) dated 30.6.2022. The simplified framework is applicable one-commerce export of jewellery made of precious metals (whether or not studded or set withprecious or semi-precious stones). This reform is aimed at supporting the Make-in-Indiabrand in the international markets and enhancing the competitiveness of Indian jewelleryexports leveraging the rapidly evolving global e-Market space.Changes in Excise Duty:● Retail selling prices of petrol and diesel in the country are linked to crude prices. The crudeprices have been varying for the past few months. Indian basket is moving upwards andreached beyond $110 per barrel in May, 2022. The Dollar exchange rate was also on theupward trend and is hovering around ₹77 per USD, impacting the prices of Petrol and Diesel.The Retail selling price of petrol and diesel have risen from ₹95.41 per litre and ₹86.67 perlitre respectively in March 2022 to ₹105.41 per litre and ₹96.67 per litre respectively on 21May, 2022. This has necessitated a reduction in Excise Duty on petrol and diesel. Extensivedeliberations were held at various stakeholders including Ministry of Petroleum and NaturalGas and it was decided to rationalise Central Excise duty rates on Petrol and Diesel by ₹8per litre on Petrol and ₹6 per litre on Diesel. The proposed reductions has been given effectto by reducing the Road and Infrastructure Cess (RIC).Changes in GST (Rates):● In 2022, the following changes were made to GST rates on goods and services:● In the 47th GST Council meeting, it was decided to increase the GST rates on items such asPrinting, writing or drawing ink, Power driven pumps primarily designed for handling watersuch as centrifugal pumps, Pawan Chakki, Drawing and marking out instruments, SolarWater Heater and system etc to correct inverted duty structure in these items. Similarly,GST rates on certain services such as Services supplied by foreman to chit fund, Job workin relation to processing of hides, skins and leather, Job work in relation to manufacture ofleather goods and footwear etc were also calibrated to correct inverted duty structure. 76 Economic Survey 2022-23● Hitherto, GST was exempted on specified food items, grains etc when not branded, or righton the brand has been foregone. In the 47th GST Council Meeting, it has been decided torevise the scope of exemption to exclude from it prepackaged and pre-labelled retail packin terms of Legal Metrology Act, including pre-packed, pre-labelled curd, lassi and buttermilk.● With an objective to rationalise GST exemptions, the 47th GST Council Meeting recommendedto withdraw GST exemption on items such as Cheques, lose or in book form, Maps andhydrographic or similar charts of all kinds, including atlases, wall maps, topographical plansand globes, printed. On similar lines, exemption in form of a concessional rate of GST isbeing rationalised on items such as Petroleum/ Coal bed methane, Scientific and technicalinstruments supplied to public funded research institutes, E-waste.Changes in GST Law and Procedure:● The following measures were undertaken for trade facilitation and ease of doing businessunder GST in 2022-23:measures intended to facilitate trade:● Retrospective amendment made in section 50 of CGST Act with effect from 01.7.2017 toprovide the interest is required to be paid on the wrongly availed ITC only when the samehas been availed as well as utilised. Also, rate of interest on wrongly availed and utilised ITCreduced to 18% from 24% with retrospective effect from 01.7.2017.● Vide Notification No. 14/2022-Central Tax dated 5.7.2022, UPI & IMPS have been providedas an additional mode for payment of GST to facilitate taxpayers and to further encouragedigital payment by amending Rule 87(3) of CGST Rules. This will provide them flexibilityand case in making their GST payment.● Transfer of CGST/IGST cash ledger balance has been allowed between 'distinct persons'(entities having same PAN but registered in different states). Facility has been provided forwithdrawal of refund applications made under GST by the taxpayers.● Facility has been provided for withdrawal of refund applications made under GST by thetaxpayers.● In GST, a mechanism has been prescribed for refund of accumulated ITC on export ofelectricity.● Procedure of sanction of IGST Refund in case of export of goods, where the exporters havebeen identified as risky, has been streamlined, to expedite verification and processing ofsuch claims.measures intended to improve ease of doing business:● Threshold for mandatory issuance of e-invoice has been reduced to ₹10 crore from01.10.2022.● To facilitate small taxpayers in making supply of goods through e-commerce operators Fiscal Developments- Revenue Relish 77(ECO), and to provide parity in intra-state offline and online supply of goods, in-principledecision has been taken for waiver of requirement of mandatory registration under GST forintra-state supply of goods through ECO's Composition taxpayers would also be allowed tomake intra-State supply through ECOs subject to certain conditions. This will open the hugee-commerce market for the small taxpayers to sell their goods without getting mandatoryregistration which will boost small business. These changes would be notified in due courseof time, as it would require amendment in GST provision, as per recommendations of GSTCouncil, and technical change on portal and also by ECOs. 04Monetary ManageMentand financial interCHAPTERMediation: a good yearThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies,after nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. Thesedevelopments led to an unprecedented, synchronous, and sharp cycle of monetarytightening across countries. Major central banks have implemented sharp increases inpolicy rates, with the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s.While the Federal Reserve has raised policy rates by 425 basis points (bps), the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) have implemented 300 bps and250 bps rate increases, respectively. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle inApril 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 bps. Consequently,domestic financial conditions began to tighten, which was reflected in the lower growthof monetary aggregates.The change in RBI’s policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidityconditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission iswell underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. Inthe government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory untilJune 2022 on concerns of high inflation and policy rate hikes. These yields moderatedin November and December 2022, aided by lower crude oil prices, a slower pace of ratehikes, and general moderation in global sovereign bond yields.While the global tightening cycle has contributed to a dampened global outlook, thedomestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduledCommercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022, with theincrease being broad-based. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies(NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital inenhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets(GNPA) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0, while the Capital-to-RiskWeighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0 and well above the regulatoryrequirement of 11.5. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. The recoveryrate for the SCBs through Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was highest in FY22compared to other channels.Political and economic developments in 2022 – the breakout of a conflict in Europe,high inflation and raising interest rates - meant that capital markets around the worldwere characterised by increased volatility. However, domestic capital markets displayedsome encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from allsegments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 79while primary private debt markets saw a growth in placements and resource mobilisation.While secondary capital market indices of the Nifty 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex werenot immune to the volatility in Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) flows, they performedbetter than their peers between April and December 2022. Furthermore, net FPI flowsturned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed adecreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over thisperiod. Both developments underscore India’s strong macroeconomic fundamentals andrelatively buoyant demand outlook.The increasing outreach of the banking sector and capital markets is reflected in theinsurance and pension sectors. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing,with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages.Important government interventions and a conducive regulatory environment havesupported the growth of the insurance market, which has seen increasing partnerships,product innovations, and vibrant distribution channels. India is poised to emerge as oneof the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector too hasbeen taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS),more recently, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increasein the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). The expansion ofthe sector has been aided by government measures such as relaxation in CCS (Pension)Rules, integration of electronic Pension Payment Order (e-PPO) with DigiLocker, andrelaxation in the timeline for submitting Digital Life Certificate.As global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph ‘higher-for-longer’policy rates in their battle against inflation, monetary conditions are expected to remaintight worldwide. Domestically, however, RBI’s support to growth will ensure adequateliquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, andcombined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle. Thecredit upcycle will also be aided by constant monitoring of the risks in the financial systemby the regulators and their efforts to contain them. Strong macroeconomic fundamentalswill underpin the return of global capital flows to India once the fog of uncertainty lifts.The financial system will play a key role in realising the objectives of Amrit Kaal.Monetary developments4.1 Inflationary pressures dominated the global economic landscape in FY23. The build-up ofprice pressures occurring in tandem with the economic recovery in FY22 from the pandemic waslong viewed as transient. It was expected to abate as supply chains normalised. The debate onsaid transience was put to rest by the conflict that erupted in Europe in February 2022. It resultedin commodity prices soaring and added significantly to the prevailing inflationary pressures.This development has triggered the current sharp and synchronous monetary tightening cycle.Setting the context, this chapter will review India’s monetary developments and the performanceof the financial system in the current financial year. It includes reviewing the monetary policyactions and their impact on system liquidity and evaluating the performance of the bankingsystem, sectoral credit developments and various insolvency frameworks. Further, it looks intothe capital market, insurance and pension sector developments. 80 Economic Survey 2022-234.2 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained a status quo on the policy repo ratebetween May 2020 and February 2022 after implementing a 115 basis points (bps) reductionbetween March 2020 and May 2020. Retail inflation has crossed the upper limit of RBI’s toleranceband since January 2022. Sensing a serious risk to price stability, RBI initiated the monetarytightening cycle. In its April 2022 meeting, the committee introduced the Standing DepositFacility (SDF), which allowed for the deposit of excess funds by banks with the RBI without thenecessity of collateral in the form of government securities, thereby allowing effective liquiditymanagement in a collateral-free manner. Here, it is worth mentioning that while the SDFwindow is available for overnight deposits, the Reserve Bank retains the flexibility to absorbsurplus liquidity of longer tenors under the window, if necessary, with appropriate pricing. TheSDF, introduced at a rate of 3.75 per cent, replaced the reverse repo rate as the new floor of theLiquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor. The MPC also indicated a change in stance from‘Accommodative’ to ‘Accommodative and focused on the withdrawal of accommodation, whilesupporting growth’ in this meeting, signalling the start of the monetary tightening cycle. 12-nuJ 12-guA 12-tcO 12-ceD 22-beF 22-rpA 22-nuJ 22-guA 22-tcO 22-ceDFixed Reverse repo rate Repo rate SDF rate MSF rateSource: RBI4.3 Recognising the sizeable upside risk imparted by adverse global developments, such asthe generalised hardening of commodity prices and an increased likelihood of prolonged supplychain disruptions, the MPC convened an off-cycle meeting in May 2022. Members unanimouslyvoted for an increase of 40 bps each in the policy repo rate, the SDF and the Marginal StandingFacility (MSF), and a 50 bps increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR). Between May 2022and December 2022 and over five meetings, the MPC implemented a cumulative hike of 225bps each in the policy repo rate, the SDF, the MSF and the bank rate. In the initial phases ofthe tightening cycle, the committee noted that commodity price-driven inflationary pressures,increased volatility and initial signs of a slowdown in output characterised the global outlook.In its latest meeting of December 5-7 2022, the MPC hiked the policy repo rate by 35 bps, andreiterated its focus on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within thetarget going forward, while supporting growth. Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 814.4 Reserve money (M0) increased by 10.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) as on 30th December2022 compared to 13 per cent last year. However, reserve money adjusted for the first-roundimpact of changes in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) recorded a YoY growth of 7.8 per centcompared to 9.1 per cent a year ago. On the component side, growth in Currency in Circulation(CIC) broadly remained stable at levels seen after Covid-19, barring a marginal increase in theimmediate aftermath of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which can be attributed toa rise in precautionary holdings. So far, expansion in M0 during FY23 was mainly driven bybankers’ deposits with the RBI, with an increase in the CRR.table iV.1: yoy growth in monetary aggregates (in per cent)item fy17^ fy18 fy19 fy20 fy21 fy22 fy23*1. reserve Money (M0) -12.9 27.3 14.5 9.4 18.8 13.0 10.31.a.

Fromthe component side, aggregate deposits have been the largest component and contributed mostto the expansion of M3 during the year so far. Amongst sources, bank credit to the commercialsector drove the expansion of broad money, and net bank credit to the government supplementedthis expansion. Of significance is the increase in the share of bank credit to the commercialsector in M3 to 64.3 per cent as on 30th December 2022 from 61.1 per cent in the correspondingperiod of the previous year, reflecting the upswing in the credit disbursal by commercialbanks.4.6 The money multiplier – the ratio of M3 and M0 – has broadly remained stable at anaverage of 5.1 over April – December 2022 period compared to 5.2 in the corresponding periodof the previous year. However, M0 adjusted for reverse repo, which is analytically akin to banks’deposits with the RBI, was much higher until April 2022. Hence, the adjusted money multiplierwas lower at 4.3 at the beginning of FY23. M0 adjusted for the reverse repo is now much closerto M0; hence, as on 30 December 2022, the money multiplier and adjusted money multiplierstood at 5.21 and 5.03, respectively.liquidity conditions4.7 Surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed post-Covid-19 in response to the Reserve Bank’sconventional and unconventional monetary measures moderated during FY23 in consonancewith the changed monetary policy stance that focused on the withdrawal of accommodation.With the MSF rate retained at 25 bps above the policy repo rate, the LAF corridor becamesymmetric around the policy repo rate - the corridor width was thus restored to 50 bps, theposition that prevailed before the pandemic.

Thegradual withdrawal of surplus liquidity pushed the weighted average call rate (WACR) – theoperating target of monetary policy – closer to the policy repo rate, on an average basis. TheWACR traded 6 bps above the policy repo rate, on an average, during H2 (up to 21 December2022) compared to 28 bps below it during H1. Interest rates on various money market rates - 91-day Treasury Bills (T-Bills), 3-month certificates of deposit and commercial papers - graduallyfirmed up in line with the increase in the repo rate.Monetary Policy transmission4.9 Lending and deposit rates of banks increased during FY23 in consonance with the policyrepo rate changes. During FY23 (up to December 2022), external benchmark-based lendingrate and 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) increased by 225bps and 115 bps, respectively. Overall, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh andoutstanding rupee loans rose by 135 bps and 71 bps, respectively, in FY23 (up to November2022).

Lower slippages and the reduction inoutstanding GNPAs through recoveries, upgrades and write-offs led to this decrease. LowerGNPAs, combined with high provisions accumulated in recent years, contributed to a decline inNNPA. There was a broad-based improvement in the GNPA ratio in the industrial sector, thoughit remained elevated for gems and jewellery and construction sub-sectors.

An increase in demand for housing inducesgreater investment which, in turn, sets off a virtuous cycle of growth and investment. Credit toagriculture and allied activities gained momentum supported by the Government’s concessionalinstitutional credit and higher agricultural credit target. Industrial credit growth has beenbuoyed by a pick-up in credit to MSMEs, assisted by the benefits accrued from the effective Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 89implementation of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and the supportprovided by the government’s production-linked incentive scheme and improvement in capacityutilisation. Credit growth in services was driven by a recovery in credit to NBFCs, commercialreal estate and trade sectors.4.20 With moderation in overseas issuances and lower investments by Private Equity (PE)/Venture Capital (VC), the financing needs of the corporate sector are being met through domesticresources. As funds raised from the primary segment of domestic equity markets declinedduring FY23, reliance on bank credit for funding regular operations and capacity expansionincreased. Also, the Incremental Credit-Deposit ratio rose sharply both on an annual (122.0per cent, YoY) and half-yearly basis (172.5 per cent; September 2022 over March 2022). Theaccumulation of deposits in the past few years has enabled banks to fund the growing creditdemand. Here, the well-capitalised banking system with a low NPA ratio and more robustcorporate sector fundamentals will continue to enhance the flow of bank credit into productiveinvestment opportunities, notwithstanding the rising interest rates.Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) Continue to Recover4.21 The growing importance of the NBFC sector in the Indian financial system is reflectedin the consistent rise of NBFCs’ credit as a proportion to GDP as well as in relation to creditextended by SCBs.

The fear of losing control over the CD upon initiation of CIRPhas nudged thousands of debtors to settle their dues even before the initiation of insolvencyproceedings. Until September 30 2022, 23,417 applications for initiation of CIRPs of CDshaving underlying default of ₹7.3 lakh crore were disposed of before their admission into CIRP.69 per cent of the distressed assets rescued, realisation value around 178 per cent of theliquidation value4.28 Until September 30, 2022, 553 CIRPs have ended in resolution. Despite the very low valueof the distressed firms to begin with, 69 per cent of distressed assets were rescued by the Code.Overall, in terms of value realisation for initiators of CIRPs (which includes Financial Creditors,Operational Creditors and Corporate Debtors), the resolution plans realised ₹2.4 lakh crore,which is 177.6 per cent of the liquidation value and 841 per cent of the fair value of the 553 CDsrescued. Moreover, realisation by financial creditors under resolution plans in comparison toliquidation value was 201 per cent, while the realisation by them was 33 per cent of their claims.92 per cent of the value realised under the liquidation Process4.29 1807 CDs ended up with orders for liquidation as of September 2022. These CDs assetswere valued at less than 8 per cent of the aggregate claim amount on the ground. However,more than 76 per cent of the CIRPs ending in liquidation (1349 out of 1774 for which data areavailable) were earlier with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and/or are defunct. The economic value of most of the corporate debtors that ended in liquidationhad almost completely eroded even before they were admitted into CIRP. 429 CDs have beencompletely liquidated.

US regulators have disqualified Bitcoin, Ether andvarious other crypto assets as securities4. A rare joint statement5 by the Federal Reserve, FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)on 3rd January 2023 highlighted their concerns about crypto-asset risks to the banking system.The geographically pervasive nature of the crypto ecosystem necessitates a common approachto the regulation of these volatile instruments. In this context, the global response to cryptos isevolving, and Box 1 captures the current state of regulatory approaches to cryptos worldwide.Box iV.1: cross country analysis: regulation of cryptocurrencyCrypto assets are new forms of digital assets implemented using cryptographic techniques. The cryptoasset market has been very volatile, with its total valuation swinging from almost US$ 3 trillion inNovember 2021 to less than US$ 1 trillion in Jan 2023. The volatility of the crypto asset ecosystemhas brought to the forefront their fragile backing and governance problems, as well as the increasingcomplexity and non-transparency. With related financial stability risks rising, the issue of crypto assetregulation has recently moved up the policy agenda of many nations.

Whilecoinmarketcap.comcrypto assets were apparently designed to disintermediate traditional financial services, this hascreated new unregulated intermediating entities. The promise of decentralisation haslso yet to berealised in practice. New centralised intermediaries, such as crypto asset exchanges, wallet providers,and crypto conglomerates, require users to trust centralised entities. The increasing importance ofthese entities could force regulators to consider them as systemic financial market infrastructures(FMIs)6. Still, the fact that they are yet largely unregulated is a cause for concern globally.4 Source:https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-cryptos-meltdown-changed-the-regulatory debate/2023/01/07/4a469c9a-8e51-11ed-b86a-2e3a77336b8e_story.html5 Joint Statement by Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230103a1.pdf6 As per Bank of International Settlements, Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) is defined as a multilateral system among participatinginstitutions, including the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities, derivatives, orother financial transactions. As per RBI, the term FMI 104 Economic Survey 2022-23Interestingly, holdings of crypto assets are primarily concentrated in the hands of a few “whales”.Estimates show that around 85 per cent of all circulating Bitcoins are held by 4.5 per cent of entities(Ben Mariem et al., 2020). The underlying protocols used to create crypto assets may also conflictwith other public policy objectives, for instance, the massive energy intensity of “mining” cryptoassets.There are minimal global standards applicable to unbacked crypto assets, which do not currentlymitigate all risks and vulnerabilities. Even as Standard-Setting Bodies (SSBs) have been making effortsto adjust and develop standards, these remain mainly focused on specific issues (financial integrity),sectors (payments, securities and banking), products (global stablecoins), or entities designated assystemic by domestic authorities. Thus, there are regulatory gaps at each stage when crypto assetsare issued, transferred, exchanged, or stored by non-bank entities. Crypto’s cross-sector and cross-border nature limits the effectiveness of uncoordinated national approaches. The terminology usedto describe the different activities, products, and stakeholders is not globally harmonised. The term“crypto asset” itself refers to a broad spectrum of digital products that may need the attention ofmultiple domestic regulators based on their actual or intended use. There is a range of crypto actors,such as miners, validators, and protocol developers, that may not be easily covered by traditionalfinancial regulation (Narain & Moretti, 2022).A few case studies7 of countries and jurisdictions attempting to regulate unbacked crypto assets arediscussed below: european Union: The European Union’s digital finance strategy comprises regulating Marketsin Crypto Assets (MiCA). Even as the focus is on stablecoins, for other crypto assets and keyentities delivering critical functions such as exchanges and wallet providers, MiCA proposesonshoring, notification and licensing regimes. Japan: The Japan Financial Services Agency introduced regulation of crypto asset serviceproviders in April 2017, mandating clients’ asset segregation, operational risk and cyber securitymanagement, Know-Your-Customer, internal audits, and minimum capital requirements. Thiswas implemented by amending the Payment Service Act. Further amendments to the law weremade in May 2019 and June 2020 to extend crypto regulation to other entities, such as walletservice providers, limit the leverage provided to retail customers by crypto asset exchanges,and introduce regulations for security tokens and stablecoins, respectively. The law for partialamendment to the Payment Services Act, etc. was enacted in June 2022 to establish a stable andefficient funds settlement system and to provide for the regulation of stablecoins. Switzerland: The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) issued guidelinesfor initial coin offerings in February 2018. Three categories of tokens were introduced: paymenttokens, utility tokens, and asset tokens (with a clarification that tradable tokens at pre-financingand presale stage could be treated as securities). Subsequently, the Financial Services Actharmonised prospectus requirements across all securities (including asset tokens) in June 2018.The distributed ledger technology (DLT) amended various civil and financial market laws inFebruary 2021 to enable the introduction of ledger-based securities on blockchain and providerules for the segregation of crypto assets in the event of bankruptcy of crypto custodians.7 generally refers to systemically important payment systems, Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), Securities Settlement Systems (SSSs),Central Counter Parties (CCPs), and Trade Repositories (TRs) that facilitate the clearing, settlement, and recording of financial transactions.IMF Fintech Notes, ‘Regulating the Crypto Ecosystem: The Case of Unbacked Crypto Assets’; https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2022/09/26/Regulating-the-Crypto-Ecosystem-The-Case-of-Unbacked-Crypto-Assets-523715 Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 105 United Kingdom: Financial Conduct Authority’s “Final Guidance on Crypto assets” declared inJune 2019 that while security tokens (crypto assets with rights and obligations similar to “specifiedinvestments”) fell inside the regulatory purview, utility and “exchange tokens” (i.e., unbackedcrypto assets) were outside of prudential and conduct regime. Following significant consumerresearch on the crypto asset market, the UK Treasury set out its roadmap for crypto asset regulationin April 2022, focusing on stablecoins and a proposal for a sandbox regime for blockchain-basedFMIs. Regarding regulating crypto asset promotions, the UK Crypto Assets Taskforce8 publisheda report in 2018 that found that misleading advertising (overstating benefits and rarely warningretail investors of volatility and risks) and lack of suitable information were vital consumerprotection issues in crypto-asset markets. In January 2022, the UK Treasury proposed bringingcrypto assets within its Financial Promotions Regime, subjecting crypto asset promotions tothe same high standards as for other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insuranceproducts. Similarly, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published guidelines to restrict themarketing of crypto assets in Singapore in January 2022, limiting crypto asset promotions to anentity’s corporate website, official social media accounts, and mobile applications. albania: Albania’s law on “DLT-based Financial Markets” (also known as the “Fintoken Act”)legalised crypto assets in Albania for investment purposes in May 2020. The regulation encompassesthe issuance of digital tokens and virtual currencies and the licensing, monitoring, and supervisionof entities engaged in distribution, trading, and custody. The Albanian Financial SupervisoryAuthority (AFSA) and the National Agency for Information Society (NAIS) are entrusted ascompetent authorities for unbacked crypto assets (and the Bank of Albania for stablecoins). It maybe noted that licensing crypto asset service providers heavily relies on third-party agents, licensedas ‘Digital Token Agents’ when focusing on regulatory and financial compliance side by AFSAand as ‘Innovative Service Providers’ when dealing with technological compliance by NAIS. nigeria: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) declared in February 2018 that crypto assets are notlegal tender in Nigeria. Further, in February 2021, the CBN wrote to regulated financial institutionsthat dealing in crypto assets and facilitating payments for crypto asset service providers wasprohibited. More recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission published “New Rules onIssuance, Offering Platforms and Custody of Digital Assets,” outlining “digital asset offerings” aswithin the purview of the SEC and imposing requirements on “digital asset offering platforms”and “digital asset offering custodians” in May 2022.Despite some progress through the AML/CFT obligations for crypto asset providers stipulatedby FATF, their implementation is still a work in progress (FATF 2021),9 with significant delaysin critical areas such as the “travel rule,” leaving the virtual asset (VA) and virtual asset serviceproviders (VASP) sector vulnerable to criminal and terrorist misuse10. As of March 2022, while29 out of 98 responding jurisdictions reported having passed Travel Rule legislation, only 11jurisdictions have started enforcement and supervisory measures.Therefore, Global standards need to be comprehensive and consistent; regulatory responses mustbe based on standard taxonomies, reliable data to address contagion effects, and flexible enoughto be adjusted in the future based on market developments and future international standards.8 The ‘UK Crypto Asset Taskforce’ comprises HM Treasury, Bank of England, and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)9 FATF, “Second 12-month Review Virtual Assets and VASPs,” FATF, (Paris, France 2021).10 FATF, “Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets/VASPs,” FATF, (Paris, France 2022). 106 Economic Survey 2022-23ifSc – gift city4.50 Over the last few years, various initiatives taken by the government have opened up newavenues and opportunities for capital market players. Setting up and operationalising India’smaiden International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City is the most important one.The aim is to facilitate India to emerge as a significant economic power by accelerating thedevelopment of a strong base of International Financial Services in the country. Box 2 belowdiscusses the key role that IFSC can play in facilitating India’s emergence as a preferredjurisdiction for international financial services and encouraging easier access and greaterparticipation from foreign investors to bring in capital to further promote India’s growth.Box iV.2: gift ifSc - emerging as a Preferred Jurisdictionfor international financial ServicesGlobally, International Financial Centres (IFCs) have assumed prominence in the financial servicesecosystem primarily because they have contributed enormously to the growth of internationalfinancial transactions. These centres have played a pivotal role in accelerating the pace of financialglobalisation. In common parlance, an IFC is a jurisdiction with a high concentration of financialinstitutions such as Banks, Stock Markets & related entities, Insurance firms, Fund Managers,FinTech firms, etc., which offer specialised financial services to non-residents and residents, in anenvironment that promotes financial innovation and facilitates cross border transactions.Given this backdrop, setting up and operationalising India’s maiden IFSC in GIFT City has beena path-breaking financial reform underpinning India’s increasingly liberal outlook towards capitalaccount convertibility. GIFT-IFSC is housed in India’s first fully operational Smart City withworld-class commercial, social and physical infrastructure. To bolster the development of IFSC, theGovernment took a major policy decision to establish the first of its kind, unified and agile financialsector regulator for IFSCs viz International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) through anAct of Parliament in 2019. From 1st October 2020, IFSCA assumed the power of four domestic sectorregulators, namely RBI, SEBI, IRDAI & Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ofIndia (PFRDAI), in so far as the development and regulation of IFSCs in India were concerned.Over the last two years, GIFT-IFSC has witnessed tremendous growth and traction across the entirespectrum of financial services, including banking, capital markets, insurance, fund management,aircraft leasing, etc. With an internationally aligned regulatory regime, competitive tax structure andbeneficial cost of operations, GIFT IFSC is now emerging as a preferred jurisdiction for internationalfinancial services. Recognising the growing significance of IFSC, the Global Financial Centres Index,London Report (March 2022) put IFSC in GIFT City at the top, among 15 centres globally, which islikely to become more significant over the next 2 to 3 years.GIFT IFSC has more than 390 + entities registered across a full spectrum of financial services,including Banks, Capital Markets, Insurance, FinTech, Aircraft Leasing, Bullion Exchange, etc.The financial services market is rapidly growing with the healthy and increasing participation ofinternational and domestic financial institutions.recent developments/milestones/innovations/collaborations with other countriesIn pursuit of its vision to become an international financial centre of global stature, IFSCA hascontinuously engaged in deliberations with many globally prominent financial authorities andstandard-setting bodies. To date, the Union Cabinet has approved the signing of 2 Multilateral MoUs Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 107(MMoU) and 7 Bilateral MoUs (BMoUs) by IFSCA to deepen cooperation with foreign regulatorsand aid the mutual exchange of information for the development of financial products and servicesin GIFT-IFSC.

Some of the projects/agreements showcasing IFSCA’s growing engagementwith the global community are highlighted below:fintech bridge with the Monetary authority of SingaporeBoth India and Singapore have been pioneers in the FinTech sector. To fuel the next phase of FinTechgrowth, the Government of India is developing GIFT IFSC as the nerve centre of all FinTechactivities. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the International Financial Services CentresAuthority (IFSCA) have signed a FinTech Co-operation Agreement (CA) to facilitate regulatorycollaboration and partnership in FinTech to promote a Joint Regulatory Sandbox Collaboration thatwill leverage existing regulatory sandboxes in their respective jurisdictions to support experimentationof technology innovations. The Agreement will enable FinTech firms from one jurisdiction to gainmarket access in the other jurisdiction through a regulatory referral system.nSe ifSc -SgX connectNSE IFSC-SGX Connect, inaugurated by the PM on July 29, 2022, is an essential milestone in thecross-border collaboration between India and Singapore in the area of capital markets. The Connect,likely to be fully operational by June 2023, will play a pivotal role in onshoring derivative tradingin NIFTY Products from SGX, Singapore, to NSE-IFSC, GIFT City.

Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 109Developments in the Insurance MarketInsurance markets globally have demonstrated remarkable flexibility and resilience inovercoming the impact of the pandemic4.51 Insurance, an integral part of the financial sector, plays a significant role in economicdevelopment. Apart from protecting against mortality, property, and casualty risks andproviding a safety net, the insurance sector encourages savings and provides long-term fundsfor infrastructure development. The development of the insurance sector is necessary to supportits continued economic transformation.4.52 Internationally, the potential and performance of the insurance sector are generallyassessed based on two parameters, viz., ‘insurance penetration’, which refers to the ratio of totalinsurance premiums to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a year and ‘insurance density’, whichrefers to the ratio of insurance premium to population, i.e.; insurance premium per capita andis measured in US Dollar, as they reflect the level of development of the insurance sector in acountry. In 2021, total global insurance premiums grew by 3.4 per cent in real terms, with thenon-life insurance sector registering 2.6 per cent growth, driven by rate hardening in commerciallines in developed markets. However, in China, the largest emerging market, non-life premiumvolumes contracted by 0.7 per cent as the de-tariffication11 of motor insurance sparked fiercecompetition and rate reductions. iums in 2021 non-life insurance premiums in 2021Eurozone 12.5 Eurozone 1.2OECD 6 OECD 2.9Emerging Economies6.7 Emerging Economies(excluding China) 4.1(excluding China)Advanced Economies 5.4Advanced Economies 2.9World 4.5World 2.6Source: Swiss Re, Sigma various issues4.53 In the life insurance segment, global premium growth bounced back strongly, registeringan increase of 4.5 per cent. The US remained the largest insurance market in the world, withtotal premiums (non-life and life) of US$ 2.8 trillion in 2021, followed by China and Japan.With the conflict in Ukraine weighing on economic growth in Europe in particular, it is expectedthat insurance industry growth in emerging markets will outpace that in the developed marketsthis year, with emerging Asia in the lead.11 De-tariffication means removing the tariff structure. This allows insurance companies to charge premiums that matches the risk profilesof its consumers. Different insurance companies can charge at a different price to its consumers for the same risk behaviour based on theirbusiness risks models and strategies. 110 Economic Survey 2022-23India poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade4.54 Insurance penetration in India increased steadily from 2.7 per cent around the turn of themillennium to 4.2 per cent in 2020 and remained the same in 2021. Life insurance penetration inIndia was 3.2 per cent in 2021, almost twice more than the emerging markets and slightly abovethe global average. However, most life insurance products sold in India are savings-linked,with just a small protection component. Hence, households remain exposed to a significantfinancing gap in the event of the premature death of the primary breadwinner. Be that as it may,the insurance density in India has increased from US$ 11.1 in 2001 to US$ 91 in 2021 (densityfor Life insurance was US$ 69 and Non-Life insurance was US$ 22 in 2021) in keeping with therelatively faster expansion of the insurance market in the country.4.55 During FY22, the gross direct premium of non-Life insurers (within and outside India)registered YoY growth of 10.8 per cent, primarily driven by health and motor segments. The netincurred claims of non-Life insurers stood at ₹1.4 lakh crore in FY22, primarily driven by risingper capita income, product innovations and customisation, development of strong distributionchannels, and rising financial literacy. The life insurance premium registered YoY growth of10.2 per cent in FY22, with new businesses contributing 45.5 per cent of the total premiumsreceived by the life insurers. The life insurance industry paid benefits of ₹5.02 lakh crore inFY22, out of which 8.3 per cent benefits were on death claims. y3.6 1.113.20.92.80.82.40.72 0.6tnecreP31-2102 41-3102 51-4102 61-5102 71-6102 81-7102 91-8102 02-9102 12-0202 22-1202tnecrePLife Insurance Non-Life Insurance (RHS)80 257020601550104030 5$SU31-2102 41-3102 51-4102 61-5102 71-6102 81-7102 91-8102 02-9102 12-0202 22-1202$SULife-Insurance Non-Life Insurance (RHS)Source: Swiss Re, Sigma various issues4.56 Public listings improve public disclosure, corporate governance, and valuation12. Inkeeping with this understanding, India’s largest life insurer, the Life Insurance Corporation ofIndia, went public in May 2022, raising US$ 2.7 billion in the country’s largest IPO to date. Theprivate insurance providers have also been seizing such opportunities. The largest private-sectorhealth insurer in the country, was listed in December 2021, making it the fifth private-sectorinsurer to IPO. The insurance sector is highly competitive and is already witnessing mergersand acquisitions (M&A) activity as insurers have tremendous opportunities and volume to co-12 https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=3619 Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 111exist in the space. Additional FDI inflows, IPOs, simplified rules & regulations and improvedcorporate valuations will likely further accelerate M&A activities in the sector. A rapidlymaturing insurance market has provided a lucrative opportunity to the government to privatizeits stake in insurance business. Accordingly, the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation)Amendment Act, 2021 allows the central government to pare its stake to less than 51 per cent ofthe equity capital in a specified insurer.4.57 To facilitate the penetration of insurance to the lower income segments of the population,the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) issued IRDAI (MicroInsurance) Regulations, 2015, which provide a platform for distributing insurance products thatare affordable for the rural and urban poor and promote financial inclusion. Further, the IRDAI(Obligations of Insurers to Rural and Social Sectors) Regulations, 2015 stipulate obligationsfor insurers in rural and social sectors and has contributed to developing and promoting micro-insurance products in India. In FY21, 10.7 lakh new micro-insurance policies were issued toindividuals with a new business premium of ₹355.3 crore (in the life-insurance segment), and53,046 new microinsurance policies were issued in the general insurance segment (excludingstandalone health insurers).4.58 Government schemes and financial inclusion initiatives have driven insurance adoptionand penetration across all segments. The government’s flagship initiative for crop insurance,Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), has led to significant growth in the premiumincome for crop insurance. Ayushman Bharat (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) (AB PM-JAY) aims at providing a health cover of ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiarycare hospitalisation. The insurance regulator IRDAI has also undertaken various initiativestowards boosting insurance penetration, such as permitting insurers to conduct video-basedKnow Your Customer (KYC), launching standardised insurance products, and allowing insurersto offer rewards for low-risk behaviour. Important government initiatives, strong demographicfactors, a conducive regulatory environment, increased M&As, product innovations, and vibrantdistribution channels are supporting the insurance market's growth.A list of various Government Insurance schemes and progress made so far is given in the tablebelow:table iV.16: government insurance schemes and progressScheme name Brief description achievementAyushman Bharat Yojana The scheme provides health Since inception, 19.7 crorecoverage of ₹5 lakh per beneficiaries have beenbeneficiary family per annum provided Ayushman cards,to poor and vulnerable and over 4.3 crore hospitalfamilies identified based admissions worth overon select deprivation and ₹0.49 lakh crore have beenoccupational criteria authorised through a networkof 28,667 empanelled health-care providers, including13,115 private hospitals as of20th January 2023. 112 Economic Survey 2022-23Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Under the scheme, risk Since its inception, 31.3Bima Yojana coverage of ₹2 lakh for crore beneficiaries have beenaccidental death and complete enrolled under the scheme,disability and ₹1 lakh for and 1.07 lakh claims havepartial disability is given to been disbursed as of 30thbeneficiaries November 2022.Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Under the scheme, risk Since its inception, 14.4Bima Yojana coverage of ₹2 Lakh is crore beneficiaries have beencredited to the savings bank enrolled under the scheme,account of the holder in case and 6.3 lakh claims haveof the death of the insured been disbursed as of 30thNovember 2022.Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Under the scheme, old age A total number of 8.6 lakhYojana income security is provided subscribers with a subscriptionto senior citizens through amount of ₹84,659.4 crorethe provision of an assured deposited by these subscriberspension/return linked to the have benefited under thesubscription amount based on scheme as of 30th Septembera government guarantee to LIC 2022Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Under the scheme, risk During 2016 and 2022,Yojana insurance is provided to 2763.9 lakh applications werefarmers against crop damage received under the scheme,due to non-preventable natural and claims of about ₹ 1.28risks from pre-sowing to post- lakh crore have been paid toharvest for the crops/areas the farmers.notified by the concernedState GovernmentSource: DFS, PIB, PMFBY Dashboard4.59 Global life premiums are expected to contract slightly in 2022 after last year’s robustrecovery from pandemic-induced lows driven by inflationary pressures, economic uncertainty,and monetary tightening. Saving premiums are expected to decline due to volatility in thefinancial markets and as disposable incomes fall. Heightened risk awareness due to Covid-19may continue to support demand for life protection (and health) insurance products.4.60 As per the Swiss Re Institute World Insurance: ‘Inflation risks front and centre report’13,India is one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the world. In total premium volumes,it was the 10th largest globally in 2021, with an estimated market share of 1.9 per cent andthe second largest of all emerging markets. India is expected to emerge as one of the top sixinsurance markets in the world by 2032, ahead of Germany, Canada, Italy, and South Korea.Further, growth in the non-life insurance sector is likely to be driven by demand for healthcoverage, with people more aware of health security post-Covid-19 and strong support from13 https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:4500fe30-7d7b-4bc7-b217-085d7d87a35b/swiss-re-institute-sigma-4-2022.pdfhttps://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/private-pensions/Pension-Markets-in-Focus-Preliminary-2021-Data-on-Pension-Funds.pdfhttps://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/ca401ebd-enpdf?expires=1672272470&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=A210559FD020AD478A4ECA831FC94891 Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 113the government-sponsored mass health program (Ayushman Bharat). Compulsory motor third-party insurance will multiply as India’s middle class expands and buys more cars.4.61 The digitisation of India’s insurance market goes beyond telematics and customer riskassessment. Many digital platforms have emerged over recent years, offering various services,including insurance purchases. These measures, accompanied by an increase in FDI limit forInsurance Companies, are likely to facilitate an increased flow of long-term capital, globaltechnology, processes, and international best practices, which will support the growth of India’sinsurance sector.Pension SectorIndia’s Pension Sector demonstrated remarkable performance during the Covid-194.62 The framework of the pension system has evolved globally. In advanced countries, thepension sector is substantial, partly stemming from a large share of formal salaried employment.While the state provides some basic pension, it is only sometimes funded and thus is a pay-as-you-go scheme relying on current government revenue for pension payments. In 2021, pensionassets in OECD countries14 stood at US$ 38.5 trillion, 66.9 per cent of the GDP. In some of theOECD countries, pension assets were over 100 per cent of the GDP. The United States recordedthe largest holdings in pension funds, followed by the United Kingdom and Australia. DuringCovid-19, countries undertook unprecedented and swift health and pension-related reforms15 toaddress health challenges, limit the impact of the crisis on labour markets, support incomes andadjust macroeconomic policies.4.63 In addition, countries took other measures to minimise the impact of Covid-19 on themarginalised, poor and vulnerable sections such as subsidising wages and pension entitlementsthrough Job Retention Scheme (JRS), broadening the access to unemployment benefits, orgrant of unemployment insurance to new groups of workers. The United States expanded thecoverage of unemployment benefits to the self-employed and Finland broadened the coverageof the already existing scheme for the self-employed. Chile permanently expanded the coverageof unemployment insurance to workers. New Zealand introduced a temporary benefit paid forup to three months to employees who lost their jobs and to the self-employed who stopped theiractivity.4.64 The Government of India announced various measures to provide pensions to families whohave lost their earning members due to Covid. It also took initiatives towards enhancing andliberalising insurance compensation. The benefit of the Employees State Insurance Corporation(ESIC) pension scheme was extended to even those who have lost earning members due toCovid-19. Dependent family members of such persons were entitled to a pension equivalentto 90 per cent of the average daily wage drawn by the worker as per the existing norms. Theinsurance benefits under the Employees Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme were alsoenhanced and liberalised.4.65 Ex-gratia of ₹1,000 was given to around three crore poor senior citizens, widows, anddisabled sections of the population (aged above 60 years) for three months during April-June2020. Rule 64 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, was relaxed to ensure immediate provisionalsanction of pensionary benefits amid the unprecedented pandemic. To enhance the “Ease of 114 Economic Survey 2022-23Living” of Central Government Civil Pensioners, an Electronic Pension Payment order (e-PPO)was integrated with Digi Locker, creating a permanent PPO record in the Digi Locker. Thetimeline for submitting Life Certificate was relaxed, along with providing a doorstep facility topensioners for submission of the life certificate digitally.4.66 The Government of India is implementing various pension schemes such as the IndiraGandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS), Indira Gandhi National WidowPension Scheme (IGNWPS), Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS)under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) with a total beneficiary coverage of4.7 crore. The National Pension System (NPS) was introduced in January 2004, the primarypension system for government employees with a pay-as-you-go defined benefit plan. NPS forgovernment employees is a defined contribution plan with co-contribution from the government.The value of the pension corpus is marked-to-market, and accordingly, the rate of return ismarket determined. NPS was extended to all the citizens of the country in the age group of18-70 years, including the unorganised sector workers (on a voluntary basis) in 2009. In orderto ensure that an avenue for savings is available to all sections of society, PFRDA launched“NPS-Corporate Sector Model” in 2011 to provide NPS to the employees of corporate entities,including PSUs.4.67 The Government introduced APY in June 2015 as a part of the overarching objective ofproviding universal social security. The scheme applies to all individuals aged 18-40 years,with an emphasis on underprivileged, unorganised, and low-income individuals. Since theintroduction of NPS and, more recently, APY, India's pension sector has expanded. The totalnumber of subscribers under the NPS and APY registered a YoY growth of 25.1 per cent inNovember 2022, with AuM witnessing a growth of 22.7 per cent during the same period. Theoverall contribution recorded an increase of 27.6 per cent in November 2022, with maximumgrowth registered by the All-Citizen model followed by the Corporate Sector.table iV.17: Performance of india’s Pension Sectorno. of contribution aUMyoy yoy yoySubscribers (₹ Crore) (₹ Crore)Nov- Nov- per per perNov-21 Nov-22 Nov-21 Nov-2221 22 cent cent centCG+SG 77 83 8 3,93,690 4,89,855 24 5,55,932 6,67,255 20Corporate+All32 42 31 8,41,80 1,19,817 42 1,07,554 1,46,705 36CitizenAPY 325 429 32 16,877 22,437 33 19,352 24,829 28Source: PFRDANote: CG stands for Central Government and SG for State Government4.68 A survey by PFRDA16 on the socio-economic characteristics of NPS subscribers (allcitizen models) for the five-year period FY17 to FY21 showed that 24 per cent were femalesubscribers, with the balance 76 per cent being male subscribers. This contrasts with a bettergender balance in the case of APY. Female subscribers under APY have increased from nearly16 https://www.pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=2170 Monetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year 11538 per cent in the initial years of the scheme to around 44 per cent by March 202117. Amongvarious states, enrolment from Maharashtra was the highest, accounting for 17 per cent. The ageprofile of the subscribers in the APY scheme suggests increasing enrolments at younger age.As of August 2022, 44.8 per cent subscribers were between 18 and 25 years, as compared to29.3 per cent as on March 201618. Further, more people are now opting for a pension amount of₹1000 per month. As of March 2022, around 76 per cent of subscribers have opted for ₹1000 permonth pension amount, as compared to 38 per cent of subscribers as on March 2016. However,the number of subscribers opting for ₹5000 per month pension has declined from 47 per centas of March 2016 to 15 per cent as of March 2022. The coverage of the population in pensionunder NPS and APY as a share of the total population has raised from 1.2 per cent to 3.7 percent during the six years FY17 to FY22. Assets as a proportion of GDP have increased from 1.2per cent to 3.2 per cent, reflecting that the pension sector is progressing much faster than thenominal growth of the economy and population.4.69 PFRDA has undertaken various measures to ease the accessibility of NPS and APYto subscribers, such as reducing timelines for processing settlements to T+2 days. CentralRecordkeeping Agencies have integrated their systems with DigiLocker to provide SubscriberCentric Services such as electronic-Pension Retirement Account Number (e-PRAN), electronicAccount statements, and Aadhar & DigiLocker-based account openings. Government sectorsubscribers can change their investment choices online by submitting the request directly in theCRA login. The contributions through the UPI handle can be accepted for the benefit of NPSsubscribers, permitting them to remit funds into their PRAN via the Virtual account numberprovided by CRA.4.70 There is tremendous scope for growth in India’s pension sector as per capita income isexpected to rise further as the economy transitions to a high-middle-income country. India’sdemographic structure, with a more significant proportion of younger people, favours a phase ofaccumulation. However, financial literacy is a significant challenge not only in emerging marketeconomies but also in advanced economies. PFRDA, under the aegis of the Financial Stabilityand Development Council (FSDC), has taken several steps to enhance financial education sothat consumers can make informed decisions and reap the benefit of the formal financial sectorwhile being cognizant of risks and various trade-offs involved. These include pension educationthrough print and electronic media, outreach programs through trade bodies, intermediariessuch as banks, and town hall events.4.71 India’s pension sector provides a flexible mode of old age income-security for salariedemployees and the common person. In the recent five years, FY18 to FY22, the number ofsubscribers has multiplied over three-fold, led by APY, and AUM by over four-fold, led byNPS. The future expansion in NPS is expected to emanate from the private sector, both thesalaried and self-employed. Steps towards enhanced pension literacy, both of the subscribersand the intermediaries, coupled with a nudge from the regulator and the government, alongwith encouragement to young adults to join a pension scheme, would accelerate the movementtowards a pensioned society.17 https://www.pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=230718 https://www.pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=2296 116 Economic Survey 2022-23Outlook4.72 The resilience of the domestic financial system is reflected in the healthy balance sheetof banks, stronger capital levels of NBFCs and robust growth in the AuM of domestic mutualfunds. Buoyant demand for bank credit and early signs of a revival in the investment cycleare benefiting from improving asset quality, a return to profitability and resilient capital andliquidity buffers. Further, IBC mechanism continues to support the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ inIndia by facilitating easy exit with time bound resolutions for firms. These strengths are helpingthe financial system absorb external spillovers, tightening global financial conditions and highvolatility in financial markets.4.73 India is one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the world and is expected toemerge as one of the top six insurance markets by 2032. Digitisation of India’s insurancemarket, accompanied by an increase in FDI limit for insurance companies, is likely to facilitatean increased flow of long-term capital, a global technology, processes, and international bestpractices, which will support the growth of India’s insurance sector. Also, as we transitionto a high middle-income economy, India's pension sector has tremendous scope for growth.Government initiatives towards enhancing pension literacy of subscribers and intermediaries,and a nudge from the regulator and the government to encourage young adults to join the pensionscheme would play a significant role in enhancing pension availability to a more extensivesection of society. 05Prices and inflation:CHAPTERsuccessful tight-roPe WalkingConsumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022. A rising phase upto April 2022 when it crested at 7.8 per cent, then a holding pattern at around 7.0 percent up to August 2022 and then a decline to around 5.7 per cent by December 2022. Therising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall incrop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country. Prompt and adequatemeasures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined inthe rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank’s tolerance limit. In contrast,major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continueto grapple with high levels of inflation.The divergence between a relatively high Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation andlower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation widened in May 2022 primarily owing to adifference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported inputcosts on retail prices. However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reducedsince then, demonstrating a tendency towards convergence. An important measureof demand-pull inflation - core inflation - remains sticky. There have been significantvariations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.According to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), theoverall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending(QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing financesector.RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy repo rate under the liquidityadjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0 per cent to 6.25 per cent between Mayand December 2022. Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reductionin excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, impositionof export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation oftariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of bufferstock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used inthe manufactured products.The RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owingto supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs.In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifyingupside risks to food prices. A lot depends on industrial input prices: they may ease, but 118 Economic Survey 2022-23on the flip side, their delayed pass-through to consumer prices may contribute to thestickiness of core inflation.In general, the year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced worldafter three to four decades, depending on the country. In India, the government and thecentral bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices. India’s retail inflation ratepeaked at 7.8 per cent in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of thetarget range in India was one of the lowest in the world. We are confident that authoritieswould remain vigilant and be as proactive as they were in 2022 should inflation pressuresre-emerge in India in 2023.introduction5.1 Rising prices are always a cause of concern for policymakers as they hurt the commonman the most. The perils of inflation are felt more in developing economies, where necessitieshave a higher share in the consumption basket than in developed countries. In recent years,India’s inflation rate has been well-behaved, lying tamely below the RBI target rate of 4 per centfrom 2017 to 2019.5.2 In 2020, supply-side disruptions pushed inflation beyond the RBI’s upper tolerance limitof 6 per cent. The pandemic delivered a larger shock on supply than it did on demand, throughsupply-chain disruptions in the case of essential goods, food, medicine and industrial goods. Inturn, this aggravated cost-push inflation in the country.5.3 As the pandemic receded, the conflict in Russia-Ukraine broke out, bringing in its wakeworldwide inflation, fuelled mostly by surging prices of crude oil and other commodities. Pricessoared to a decadal high and ate into household budgets, in turn prodding Central Banks totighten monetary policy. A convalescing world economy was left to confront unprecedentedrates of inflation. The spectre of stagflation loomed large on the horizon. In response, developedeconomies were left with no option but to raise interest rates. As the US Federal Reserve raisedrates, the US dollar appreciated, making dollar-denominated fuel imports even dearer.5.4 In advanced economies, the rate of inflation is projected by the International MonetaryFund (IMF) to increase from 3.1 per cent in 2021 to 7.2 per cent in 2022, the highest since 1982.The Euro area saw the rate reach 10.0 per cent in September 2022 (WEO, October 20221). TheUS inflation reached its 40-year high at 9.1 per cent in June 2022 before moderating to 6.5 percent in December 2022, while the UK saw an annual price rise of 9.2 per cent in December 2022.Germany witnessed inflation of 8.6 per cent in December 2022. Among emerging markets,Brazil saw a moderation in price trends, while Turkey’s inflation was above 80 per cent fromAugust to November 2022 before declining slightly to 64.3 per cent in December 2022. Thewar had compounded the effects of a strong recovery in demand for goods and services afterthe pandemic. The inflation rate in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs)is anticipated to have increased from 5.9 per cent in 2021 to 9.9 per cent in 2022 (WEO,October 2022).1 World Economic Outlook (WEO), IMF, October 2022 Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking 119Figure V.1: Record Consumer Price Inflation in 2022 Calendar Year9.98.17.1 7.25.7 5.8 5.95.55.0 5.1 5.14.7 4.74.4 4.5 4.43.12.72.0 2.01.71.5 1.4 1.4 1.40.8 0.70.32010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023)tnecrep(etaRnoitalfnIAdvanced economies EMDEsSource: World Economic Outlook, October 2022, IMFNote: *The  ies and EMDEs include 156 economies as per IMF classificationFigure V.2: High Consumer Price Inflation in Advanced Economies131211109 9.28.6876.565.854Jan-22 Feb-22 Mar-22 Apr-22 May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22 Aug-22 Sep-22 Oct-22 Nov-22 Dec-22)tnecrep(etaRnoitalfnIU.K USA Brazil GermanySource: OECD5.5 The groundwork for the commendable inflation management in India was laid earlier asfiscal and monetary measures adopted to stave off the pandemic-induced economic woes wereprudent and well-calibrated. India chose not to overstimulate, and hence price pressures due to 120 Economic Survey 2022-23the Russia-Ukraine conflict could be contained. Excessive heat in summer and uneven rainfallthereafter in some parts of the country affected the farm sector, reducing supply and causingprices of some major products to rise. India’s inflation rate peaked in April 2022 at 7.8 per centbefore moderating to 5.7 per cent in December 2022 on the back of good monsoons as well asprompt government measures that ensured adequate food supply. Global economic slowdownand interest rate increases brought down commodity prices, contributing to a substantial declinein wholesale price inflation. Thus, input price pressures on Indian manufacturers abated.5.6 Even as inflation abated at the wholesale level, there has been a pass-through of previouslyhigh input costs onto retail prices. Core inflation remains sticky at nearly 6 per cent and reflects thesecond-round effects of the supply shocks witnessed earlier this year. Further, with the recoveryof demand, there has been a pickup in service inflation. Against this backdrop, we discuss trendsand drivers of retail and wholesale price inflation in FY22 and FY23, state-wise and rural-urban differential in consumer inflation, fuel price inflation, CPI and WPI convergence, housingprices, pharmaceutical pricing and fiscal as well as monetary policy measures undertaken tocontain inflation as the chapter proceeds.Domestic Retail InflationHeadline Inflation Declined from its Peak5.7 FY22 witnessed lower CPI-Combined (CPI-C) based retail inflation as compared to FY21.Even so, inflation remained on the higher side when compared to the moderation seen during theyears prior to the pandemic. During FY22, some sub-groups such as ‘oils & fats’, ‘fuel & light’and ‘transport & communication’ reported high inflation. This was mainly driven by supplydisruptions caused by pandemic-induced lockdowns. The subsequent year (FY23) began withthe Russia-Ukraine crisis that led to high headline inflation rate in April 2022.5.8 In FY23, retail inflation was mainly driven by higher food inflation, while core inflationstayed at a moderate level. Food inflation ranged between 4.2 per cent to 8.6 per cent between Apriland December 2022, while the core inflation rate stayed at around 6 per cent except in April 2022.Table V.1: Average Annual Retail Inflation Based on CPI-C (per cent) (base: 2012=100)Groups/Sub-groups Weight FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*Food & beverages 45.9 6.0 7.3 4.2 7.0Cereals and products 9.7 2.8 3.8 0.5 9.3Meat and fish 3.6 9.3 15.4 7.9 4.7Egg 0.4 4.5 12.9 7.6 -1.0Milk and products 6.6 2.9 5.4 2.8 6.8Oils and fats 3.6 2.9 16.0 27.4 5.4Fruits 2.9 0.7 2.6 6.2 4.4Vegetables 6.0 21.3 5.8 -7.2 7.6Pulses and products 2.4 9.9 16.4 6.0 1.8 Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking 121Weight FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*Sugar and confectionery 1.4 0.8 2.5 2.3 2.7Spices 2.5 4.4 10.9 5.3 14.9Pan, tobacco & intoxicants 2.4 4.2 9.9 4.5 2.0Clothing & footwear 6.5 1.6 3.4 7.2 9.7housing 10.1 4.5 3.3 3.7 4.1Fuel and light 6.8 1.3 2.7 11.3 10.5Miscellaneous 28.3 4.4 6.6 6.7 6.3Household goods and services 3.8 3.1 3.0 5.8 7.5Health 5.9 6.2 5.1 7.5 5.8Transport and communication 8.6 2.4 9.9 10.1 6.4Recreation and amusement 1.7 4.9 5.1 6.5 6.4Education 4.5 5.5 2.8 2.9 5.2Headline Inflation 100.0 4.8 6.2 5.5 6.8Core Inflation 47.3 4.0 5.5 6.0 6.1Food Inflation 39.1 6.7 7.7 3.8 7.0Source: MoSPI,Note: *April-December, CPI data for December 2022 are provisionalFigure V.3: Declining Food Inflation but Sticky Core Inflation109876543210Apr-21 May-21 Jun-21 Jul-21 Aug-21 Sep-21 Oct-21 Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22 Feb-22 Mar-22 Apr-22 May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22 Aug-22 Sep-22 Oct-22 Nov-22 Dec-22)tnecrep(etaRnoitalfnIHeadline Inflation Food Inflation Core InflationSource: MoSPI 122 Economic Survey 2022-23Retail Inflation Driven by Food Commodities5.9 Retail price inflation mainly stems from the agriculture and allied sector, housing, textiles,and pharmaceutical sectors.

India meets 60 per cent of its edibleoils demand through imports, making it vulnerable to international movements in prices. Forinstance, sunflower oil, which makes up 15 per cent of our total edible oil imports, is procuredmainly from Ukraine and Russia. Thus, FY22 saw edible oil inflation on account of internationalprice pressures. However, inflation remained subdued in FY23 because of rationalisation oftariffs and the imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds.Figure V.8: Imported Inflation in Edible Oils300250200150100500xednI02-rpA 02-luJ 02-tcO 12-naJ 12-rpA 12-luJ 12-tcO 22-naJ 22-rpA 22-luJ 22-tcO2702502302101901701501301109070Oils & fats (CPI Index), Base 2012 130 150 170 190 210FAO Food Price Index (Oils), Base 2014-2016)sliO(xednIecirpdoofOAFCorrelation Coefficient = 0.88Oils & Fats (CPI Index)Source: FAO and MoSPIFigure V.9: Import of Edible Oils1801601401201008060402002016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22eulaV&ytitnauQQuantity (lakh tonne) Value (₹'000 crore)Source: Solvent Extractors Association of IndiaNote: Data corresponding to oil year (November-October) 126 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure V.10: Moderating Retail Prices of Edible Oils200190180170160150140130120110100Apr-21 May-21 Jun-21 Jul-21 Aug-21 Sep-21 Oct-21 Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22 Feb-22 Mar-22 Apr-22 May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22 Aug-22 Sep-22 Oct-22 Nov-22 Dec-22)gk/₹(ecirPSoya Oil Palm Oil Sunflower OilSource: DoCABox V.1: Measures to Contain Inflation in Essential Food CommoditiesThe government keeps a close watch on the production and availability of essential commoditiesthrough regular reviews by the Inter-Ministerial Committee and Committee of Secretaries.

CPI-C based food inflation seemsto have cooled down after reaching a high of 8.3 per cent in April 2022 due to a subsequentmoderation in global food prices and a reduction in farm input costs. However, the coolingwas more pronounced for urban inflation, which softened to 2.8 per cent in December 2022.Rural fuel inflation remained lower than its urban counterpart throughout the current fiscal, dueto subdued price pressures on traditional fuel items such as firewood and cow dung cakes asopposed to petrol and diesel.5.16 While the current fiscal year saw rural and urban inflation closely tracking each other,FY22 had seen a wider differential between the two. The gap between rural and urban inflationreached its widest in March 2022 due to a difference in the experience of food inflation.

As a result, the wholesale inflation rate climbed to about13.0 per cent in FY22. Prices of items like petroleum products, basic metals, chemicals &chemical products, and edible oils, with maximum exposure to international pricing translatedinto a rise in the domestic WPI inflation. 130 Economic Survey 2022-23Table V.2: Average Annual Wholesale Inflation Based on WPI (per cent) (Base: 2011-12=100)Groups/Subgroups Weight FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*Primary Articles 22.6 6.8 1.7 10.3 12.3Food articles 15.3 8.4 3.1 4.1 8.3Cereals 2.8 7.5 -2.6 1.6 10.7Pulses 0.6 15.9 11.6 6.9 0.0Vegetables 1.9 31.2 3.4 0.4 13.2Fruits 1.6 3.2 1.4 11.3 10.4Non-Food Articles 4.1 4.5 1.4 21.1 12.0Minerals 0.8 13.2 6.7 19.6 6.2Crude Petroleum & Natural Gas 2.4 -7.7 -17.5 56.7 57.7Fuel & power 13.2 -1.8 -8.0 32.6 33.8LPG 0.6 -8.3 -2.7 43.3 16.9Petrol 1.6 -3.2 -11.8 62.9 41.9High Speed Diesel 3.1 -3.5 -14.4 59.9 60.8Manufactured Products 64.2 0.3 2.7 11.1 7.1Food products 9.1 4.1 5.6 11.7 6.0Edible oils 2.6 1.4 20.3 30.5 1.4Food Inflation (Food articles + Food products) 24.4 6.9 3.9 6.8 7.5Core Inflation (Manufactured Products-Food55.1 -0.4 2.2 11.0 9.2products)Headline Inflation 100 1.7 1.3 13.0 11.5Source: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIITNote: *April-December 2022, WPI data for November and December 2022 are provisional5.20 Part of the double-digit inflation in WPI during H1 of FY23 could be attributed to foodinflation, which stayed at 7.5 per cent against 6.8 per cent in FY22. Cereals and vegetableswere the major contributors to food inflation owing to erratic climatic conditons. Inflation inthe ‘manufactured products’ subgroup in FY23 saw a considerable decline compared to theprevious year due to the rationalisation of duties on critical inputs and moderation in globalcommodity prices. In comparison to FY22, core inflation remained lower in FY23.5.21 Overall, the monthly trend of inflation rates based on wholesale prices has been slidingdownwards from its peak of 16.6 per cent in May 2022 to 10.6 per cent in September 2022 andfurther to 5.0 per cent in December 2022. The decline in inflation was observed in all threesubgroups of WPI.5.22 As mentioned earlier, part of WPI inflation is imported inflation. The high import dependenceon edible oils has meant that the transitory effect of rising international prices of these productsare also reflected in domestic prices. An RBI study3 indicates that one per cent increase in pricesacross all the countries and sectors due to global inflation shock could increase inflation in Indiaby around 63 basis points through second-round effects comprising domestic indirect effects (463 Monetary Policy Report, RBI, September 2022 Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking 131basis points) and global spillovers (17 basis points), in addition to the direct impact of 100 basispoints. The impact of prices in world markets on WPI (manufactured products component) wasclearly visible, especially in prices of oil and basic metals. In the current financial year, globalprices of edible oils, rubber, cotton, crude oil, and metals decreased. Capital outflows in H1 ofFY23 had impacted India’s exchange rate adversely; this was another reason for high prices ofimported inputs, which are mostly dollar-denominated.Figure V.14: Declining Core and Food Inflation181614121086420Apr-21 May-21 Jun-21 Jul-21 Aug-21 Sep-21 Oct-21 Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22 Feb-22 Mar-22 Apr-22 May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22 Aug-22 Sep-22 Oct-22 Nov-22 Dec-22)tnecrep(etaRnoitalfnIHeadline Inflation Food Inflation Core InflationSource: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIITFigure V.15: Drivers of Wholesale Inflation in FY23* – 'Primary Articles' & 'Fuel & Power'22.6 13.2 64.2700.060-5000.050-10000.040-15000.030-20000.02010 -25000.00-30000.0Primary Articles Fuel & Power Manufactured Products)tnecrep(noitubitnoCFY21 FY22 FY23* WeightsSource: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIITNote: *April-December 132 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure V.16: Slackening Global Commodity Prices300025002000150010005000)tm/$(ecirP12-ceD 22-naJ 22-beF 22-raM 22-rpA 22-yaM 22-nuJ 22-luJ 22-guA 22-peS 22-tcO 22-voN 22-ceD4.03.53.02.52.01.51.00.50.0Palm oil ($/mt) Soybean oil ($/mt)Sunflower oil ($/mt))gk/$(ecirP12-ceD 22-naJ 22-beF 22-raM 22-rpA 22-yaM 22-nuJ 22-luJ 22-guA 22-peS 22-tcO 22-voN 22-ceDCotton, A Index ($/kg) Rubber, TSR20 ($/kg)1601501401301201101009080)*utmd/$(ecirP12-ceD 22-naJ 22-beF 22-raM 22-rpA 22-yaM 22-nuJ 22-luJ 22-guA 22-peS 22-tcO 22-voN 22-ceD110001000090008000700060005000400030002000Iron ore, cfr spot ($/dmtu))tm/$(ecirP12-ceD 22-naJ 22-beF 22-raM 22-rpA 22-yaM 22-nuJ 22-luJ 22-guA 22-peS 22-tcO 22-voN 22-ceDAluminum ($/mt) Copper ($/mt)45000400003500030000250002000015000)tm/$(ecirP12-ceD 22-naJ 22-beF 22-raM 22-rpA 22-yaM 22-nuJ 22-luJ 22-guA 22-peS 22-tcO 22-voN 22-ceD4500400035003000250020001500Tin ($/mt) Nickel ($/mt))tm/$(ecirP12-ceD 22-naJ 22-beF 22-raM 22-rpA 22-yaM 22-nuJ 22-luJ 22-guA 22-peS 22-tcO 22-voN 22-ceDLead ($/mt) Zinc ($/mt)Source: Pink Sheet, World BankNote: *dmtu:dry metric tonne unit Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking 133Box V.2: Measures to Contain Inflation in Input Prices Fuel Prices: The Central Government has made interventions by calibrating the excise dutieson petrol and diesel.

In response to subdued global demand because of Covid-19induced restrictions, the price of the Indian basket of crude oil during FY21 stayed in the rangeof US$20-65/bbl. Thereafter, prices started surging on account of unprecedented cuts in crudeoil supply by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil-producing countries. The upward trend continued in FY22 and FY23, as demand picked upwith the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in most regions of the world. Also, owing to supplydisruption amid rising tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East in June 2022, the Indianbasket of crude oil peaked at US$116/bbl. Subsequently, the price declined to US$ 78/bbl inDecember 2022. Further, a cut in central excise duty on petrol and diesel in November 2021 andMay 2022, followed by a reduction in Value Added Tax (VAT) by the State Governments, led toa moderation of the retail selling price of petrol and diesel in India. 134 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure V.17: Moderation in Crude Oil Prices130120110100908070Dec-21 Jan-22 Feb-22 Mar-22 Apr-22 May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22 Aug-22 Sep-22 Oct-22 Nov-22 Dec-22)lbb/$SU(ecirPBrent Crude Oil Crude oil (Indian basket)Source: Pink Sheet, World Bank and PPAC, MoPNGConvergence of WPI and CPI Inflation5.24 Inflation dynamics in India since the outbreak of the pandemic have been influenced byvarious domestic and global factors. While the pass-through of international prices to wholesaleprices is relatively quick, it impacts retail prices with a lag. This creates a wedge between WPIand CPI inflation rates. It is also due to the difference in composition and weights assigned todifferent commodities in the two indices.5.25 The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, asWPI inflation touched double digits due to unfavourable base effects while CPI-C inflationremained stable. The wedge between CPI-C and WPI inflation continued to widen beforereaching its peak at 10 per cent in November 2021. Thereafter, the gap began to narrow untilApril 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressurestarted building up in February 2022 as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The majorbrunt of commodity supply chain disruption and increased demand for essentials was reflectedin WPI with a short lag of 2 months. As a result, the two indicators of inflation again starteddiverging in May 2022. It was only after global commodity prices, including crude oil, softenedand the effects of strong supporting domestic factors like favourable monsoon, vaccination-ledeconomic resumption, etc., started to be felt that the wedge began to narrow, and it closed inNovember 2022, after 21 months. It also indicated the near completion of the pass-through ofhigh input costs to the retail segment.5.26 The convergence between the WPI and CPI indices was mainly driven by two factors.Firstly, a cooling in inflation of commodities such as crude oil, iron, aluminium and cottonled to a lower WPI. These commodities occupy a larger weight in the WPI as compared to theCPI. Further, these commodities are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices and Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking 135are used intensively by industries producing wholesale goods. As the prices cooled for thesecommodities, the two measures of inflation began to converge. Secondly, CPI inflation rose dueto an increase in the prices of services.

The RBI’sanchoring of inflationary expectations through forward guidance and responsive monetarypolicy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country. The one-year-ahead inflationaryexpectations by businesses have shown a decreasing trend in the current fiscal. As businesses areprice-setters, their perceptions on inflation are significant in making sense of whether costs wouldbe passed on, resulting in higher prices in the near future. Similarly, inflationary expectations byhouseholds- who are the price takers of the economy- determine their consumption choices inthe near future. Much like businesses, household inflation expectations too have moderated.Figure V.23: Business and Household Inflationary Expectations are Falling6.56.05.55.04.54.0Jul-21 Sep-21 Nov-21 Jan-22 Mar-22 May-22 Jul-22 Sep-22 Nov-22)tnecrep(snoitatcepxEnoitalfnIBusiness Inflation Expectations 1 Year Ahead13.012.512.011.511.010.510.09.59.0Jul-21 Sep-21 Nov-21 Jan-22 Mar-22 May-22 Jul-22 Sep-22 Nov-22)tnecrep(snoitatcepxEnoitalfnIHousehold Inflation Expectations 1 Year AheadSource: IIM-A and RBI 138 Economic Survey 2022-23Monetary Policy Measures for Price stability5.28 Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased the policy repo rateunder the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 2.25 per cent (225 basis points) from 4.0 percent to 6.25 per cent between May and December 2022.Table V.3: Monetary Policy Statements – Tightening Monetary PolicyDate of MPC Statements Changes in the Policy Repo Rate under the LAF8 April 2022 Unchanged at 4 per cent4 May 2022 Increased from 4.0 per cent to 4.4 per cent (40 basis points)8 June 2022 Increased from 4.4 per cent to 4.9 per cent (50 basis points)5 August 2022 Increased from 4.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent (50 basis points)30 September 2022 Increased from 5.4 per cent to 5.9 per cent (50 basis points)7 December 2022 Increased from 5.9 per cent to 6.25 per cent (35 basis points)Source: RBIBox V.3: How is the Current Inflation Different from the 1970s?Unprecedented global inflation in the current year recalls the experience of the 1970’s, particularlythe aftermath of the oil crises in 1973 and 1979. Both crises contributed to rising commodity pricesworldwide and their spill-over effects on the prices of other goods and services. However, theenvironment and intensity of the crises differ in various respects.Firstly, recent oil price rises are proportionally smaller than the 1970s crisis, which had taken oilprices to historic highs.Secondly, in contrast to the 1970s crisis, which was confined to oil prices, the recent crisis has seenpervasive price increases across a broader range of commodities. Prices of non-oil energy, someagricultural goods, fertilisers, and metals have all risen well above their pre-pandemic levels in thecurrent year.Thirdly, commodity supply disruptions have played a smaller role in recent price increases than inthe 1970s. The rise in commodity prices over the past year has been accompanied by a modest risein the production of many commodities, although not oil. Global commodity supply chains have nowbecome more efficient than in the 1970s and hence, the inflationary pressure can be absorbed withgreater ease. However, supply disruptions could intensify over the coming year, as the war in Ukrainewill lower global production of wheat, maize and fertilisers, while price caps on Russian oil and gasmay reduce the supply of these products.Fourthly, global inflation, which has risen significantly since the start of 2021, follows several yearsof low inflation. In contrast to this, the 1973 crisis took place against a backdrop of several years ofsteadily rising world inflation and signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking 139Lastly, the 1973 crisis closely followed the collapse of the Bretton Woods managed exchange rateregime as the goals and even instruments of monetary policy were poorly defined in many countries.Arguably, central banks have much clearer and more robust institutional frameworks that focus onprice stability today. This has prevented inflation expectations of the public from becoming unanchoreddespite a sharp rise in inflation during the year 2022.Besides commodity market behaviour, higher energy prices could matter less today than in the past. Withbetter coordination among the global central banks and the application of unconventional monetarypolicy tools, inflation has been controlled in a better way so that its negative spillovers are limited andtransitory. The energy intensity of GDP – the amount of energy required to produce a given amount ofgoods and services - has fallen by around 40 per cent since the late 1970s. With the diversification ofinput baskets and destinations for sourcing, commodity shocks’ impact has been tamed to some extent.Hence, we may expect recent commodity price rises to be less disruptive than those of the 1970s.Source: Annual Economic Report, June 2022 by Bank for International Settlements and Vox EU, 2022 (https://bit.ly/3XpYqsI)Housing Prices: Recovering Housing Sector After the Pandemic5.29 Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and bustsin asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances. Monitoring housing prices is essentialfor achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth. Movements inthese prices affect consumption spending through its effects on household wealth and consumerconfidence.5.30 The National Housing Bank (NHB) publishes two Housing Price Indices (HPI), namely‘HPI assessment price’ and ‘HPI market price quarterly’, with FY18 as the base year. HPIassessment price is based on the valuation prices of residential units collected from primarylending institutions. In contrast, the HPI market price is based on the market prices for unsoldinventories collected from developers. A composite index is calculated for 50 cities across Indiausing the population of the cities as weights.5.31 The annual variation in HPI market price ranged from an increase of 37.7 per cent inBhubaneshwar to a contraction of 6.5 per cent in Indore in the Quarter Ending (QE) Sept 22over QE Sept 21. Out of the 50 cities, 43 saw an increase in the index, whereas 7 cities showeda decline annually. All of the eight major metros of the country, viz., Ahmedabad, Bengaluru,Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune, recorded increases in the index on anannual basis.5.32 The annual change in HPI assessment price varied widely across the cities ranging from anincrease of 20.2 per cent in Gandhinagar to a decline of 2.3 per cent in Bhiwadi in the QE Sept22 over QE Sept 21. Out of the 50 cities, 46 cities registered an increase in the index, whereas4 cities experienced a decline, on an annual basis.

Healthconcerns and stay-at-home orders led to fewer buyers looking for homes during the initialphase of the pandemic in April-June, 2020. Subsequently, India’s real estate industry gainedmomentum from September 2020 onwards and peaked in the quarter ending in March 2021.The second wave of the pandemic affected the real estate sector yet again when home buyersdelayed purchases due to mounting uncertainty and restricted movement. However, timelypolicy intervention by the government coupled with low home loan interest rates propped updemand and attracted buyers more readily in the affordable segment in FY23. The overallincrease in composite HPI assessment and HPI market prices indicates a revival in the housingfinance sector. A stable to moderate increase in HPI also offers confidence to homeowners andhome loan financiers in terms of the retained value of the asset.Box V.4: NHBs Support to the Housing Finance Sector (HFC)The last three years were challenging for the housing sector. NHB has provided a significant impetusto obviate the liquidity issues faced by the Housing Finance Sector in the last 3 years. The Liquidity Infusion Facility Scheme was launched in 2019 to support HFCs in creatingindividual housing loan portfolios that fall under the priority sector, as defined by the RBI. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Special Refinance Facility (SRF) was launched for disbursingan amount of `10,000 crore provided by RBI under the Special Liquidity Facility and an amountof `5,000 crore allocated by RBI under an Additional Special Liquidity Facility. During 2020-21, SRF 2021 was launched with a corpus of `10,000 crore provided by RBI underSLF-2. NHB has provided refinance disbursement of `3.3 lakh crore since inception, of which`0.84 lakh crore were disbursed during last 3 financial years. Also, as a part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav (AKAM), NHB has extended concessions of25/30 basis points under refinance for the various categories including women, rural areas, SC/ST, aspirational districts, north-eastern region, loans to third gender/differently abled/disabled,UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, and green housing. 142 Economic Survey 2022-23 In view of the nation’s commitment at COP26 to reach net-zero emission by 2070, NHB hasextended 100 bps concession for loans under Green Housing. As part of AKAM and to increase the credit offtake in geographically underpenetrated areaswhich are a national priority, NHB has decided to extend 100 bps concession and refinance forloans in designated aspirational districts, north-eastern States, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh,until September 2023.Keeping check on Phamaceutical Prices5.34 The principles for the regulation of the prices of drugs are based on the NationalPharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012, administered by the Department of Pharmaceuticals.The key principles of the policy are the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation pricesand market-based pricing. Until 31 December 2022, ceiling prices for 890 formulations of358 drugs/medicines across various therapeutic categories under National List of EssentialMedicines (NLEM), 2015 have been fixed by National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority.Subsequently, NLEM 2022 was promulgated by Ministry of Health and Family Welfarein September 2022 and revised Schedule I of Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO) wasnotified on 11 November 2022 by Department of Pharmaceuticals incorporating NLEM,2022. Ceiling prices of 119 formulations under NLEM, 2022 have been fixed until 31December 2022. In addition, retail prices for 2,196 formulations have been fixed under theDPCO, 2013.5.35 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched to make qualitygeneric medicines available at affordable prices to all. Under this scheme, dedicated outletsknown as Janaushadhi Kendras are opened to provide quality generic medicines at affordableprices to all and especially to the poor and the deprived. Further, Pradhan Mantri BhartiyaJanaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs) also provide self-employment with sustainable and regularearnings opportunities. Under the PMBJP, until 31 December 2022, more than 9000 PMBJKshave been opened across the country. At present, the product basket of PMBJP comprises 1759medicines and 280 surgical devices available for sale.Conclusion5.36 It is not wishful thinking that 2023 will show less macroeconomic volatility than itspreceding financial year. Both CPI-C and WPI have fallen below 6 per cent (which is theRBI tolerance limit for the former) and are on the descending slope of the surge that hit theeconomy in the first half of the current fiscal. International crude oil prices, the principal driversof inflation this financial year, have returned to normal levels and so have prices of other majorcommodities. RBI projects CPI inflation for Q1 - FY24 at 5.0 per cent and for Q2 -FY24 at 5.4per cent on the assumption of a normal monsoon.5.37 India’s inflation management has been particularly noteworthy and can be contrasted withadvanced economies that are still grappling with sticky inflation rates. Due to the anticipatedslowdown in advanced economies, inflation risks coming from global commodity prices arelikely to be lower in FY24 than in FY23. However, in terms of overall risks to the benignbaseline view on inflation, upside risks to India's projected rates may outweigh the downside Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking 143risks. For instance, the re-emergence of Covid-19 in China can trigger supply chain disruptionsas was the case during the pandemic period. On the other hand, if China returns to normalcyfrom Covid-19, there can be a surge in commodity demand - thus reversing the recent slumpin commodity prices. Further, the probability of a soft landing in the US economy has risenin recent months, and that might keep up the US demand for oil. Similarly, the geopoliticsassociated with oil can particularly affect our imported inflation.5.38 RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term owing tosupply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike reflecting high feed costs. In general,climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to foodprices. A lot depends on industrial input prices: they may ease, but on the flip side their delayedpass-through to consumer prices may contribute to the stickiness of core inflation.5.39 Still, overall, the inflation challenge in FY24 must be a lot less stiff than it has been thisyear. We expect monetary and fiscal authorities to be as proactive and vigilant as they have beenthis year.***** 06Social infraStructureCHAPTERand employment: big tentPost the massive, unexpected disruption to human lives caused by the global pandemic,the year 2022 was when humanity once again picked up the threads and took small stepsto get back to a semblance of normalcy. However, the challenges posed by the aftermathof this crisis, subsequent waves of the pandemic and the ensuing Russia-Ukraine conflicthave impacted the global as well as India’s development trajectory. There was a stress onkey aspects of social well being of citizens such as health, education and social securityetc. and the Government stepped in to continue its support towards social infrastructuredevelopment. Standing on the brink of FY23, various indicators of social developmentappear to have recouped. Focus on long-term goals of human development and “sabkasath, sabka vikas” have assumed salience. The social sector expenditure outlay of theCentre and State Governments has increased steadily to stand at ₹21.3 lakh crore in FY23(BE), with its share in total General Government expenditure standing at 26.6 per cent.Demonstrating the on-track progress to attain Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) ofhalving poverty by 2030, more than 41 crore people exited poverty between 2005-06and 2019-21 according to the UN Mutilidimensional Poverty Index. Bouquet of socialprotection schemes, customised for different sections of the population such as elderly,unorganised workers, have been prioritised ensuring a shield of dignity for every memberof society. The special focus on aspirational districts has resulted in steady improvementsacross health, education, financial inclusion, and basic infrastructure. Transformingwelfare through technology, Aadhaar and JAM trinity have revolutionalised the universeof state-citizen interaction, enabling targeted delivery of Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT)through 318 Central schemes and over 720 State DBT schemes, seamless portability ofration card across States through ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ and national databaseof unorganised workers ‘eShram portal’. The broad-based improvement in employmentindicators is observed in data covering both the supply side and demand side of thelabour market.Labour markets have recovered beyond pre-Covid levels, in both urban and ruralareas, as observed in supply-side and demand-side employment data. Quarterly urbanemployment data shows progress beyond pre-pandemic levels as the unemployment ratedeclined from 8.3 per cent in July-September 2019 to 7.2 per cent in July-September2022. Reflecting rising formalisation of employment, net addition to EPFO payroll issteadily moving upward after swiftly rebounding from Covid-19, with the majority sharecoming from the youth. As per Annual Survey of Industries 2019-20, employment in theorganised manufacturing sector has maintained a steady upward trend over time, withthe employment per factory also increasing gradually. Employment has been rising faster Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 145in factories employing more than 100 workers than in smaller ones, suggesting scalingup of manufacturing units. Year-on-Year (YoY) decline in monthly demand for MahatmaGandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) work is emanatingfrom normalisation of the rural economy due to strong agricultural growth and a swiftbounce-back from Covid-19.The noticeable rise in Rural Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) from19.7 per cent in 2018-19 to 27.7 per cent in 2020-21 is a positive development. Notably,India’s female LFPR is likely to be underestimated, with reforms in survey design andcontent required to capture the reality of working females more accurately. Self-HelpGroups (SHGs), having demonstrated their resilience and flexibility during Covid, can bean effective conduit to tap the rising willingness of females to work. The 1.2 crore SHGs,comprising of 88 per cent all women SHGs, cater to 14.2 crore households.On the human capital formation front, the twin pillars of education and health are beingstrengthened from the core. Within the progressive framework of the National EducationPolicy (NEP), the improvement in basic facilities in schools and the rising availabilityof teachers is expected to yield dividends which will enrich the nation’s growth anddevelopment prospects in the decades to come. The Government has also strengthenedthe health infrastructure and prepared itself to address present and future needs .Ensuring the provision of quality health facilities to citizens, the share of governmenthealth expenditure in total health expenditure has increased from 28.6 per cent in FY14to 40.6 per cent in FY19, with a concomitant decline in out-of-pocket expenditure asa percentage of total health expenditure from 64.2 per cent in FY14 to 48.2 per centin FY19. Augmenting the rural public healthcare system, the number of Sub-centres,Primary Health Centres (PHCs), and Community Health Centres (CHCs) have improvedsubstantially, along with a rise in doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel in the pasteight years. Consequently, a host of health-related indicators such as institutional births,immunisation and, coverage of health insurance, have witnessed an uptrend, as borneout by National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data. The progress of the path-breakingAyushman Bharat programme, with nearly 22 crore beneficiaries, is being further tech-enabled through digital health IDs ‘ABHA’ and telemedicine through e-Sanjeevani.In the Amrit Kaal, the lives of two-thirds of the Indian populace residing in rural India lookremarkably better than a few years back, aided by the policy focus on basic amenities andefficient programme implementation. Outcome-oriented statistics concerning the qualityof rural lives establish tangible progress in access to electricity, presence of improveddrinking water sources, coverage under health insurance schemes, women empowerment,etc. The emphasis on digital land records through SVAMITVA is structural reform in ruralland management and individual economic empowerment.As India marches ahead, the ground lost as regards social sector improvements due tothe pandemic has largely been recouped, powered by prompt policymaking and efficientimplementation interwoven with technology. Going forward with the vision of ‘MinimumGovernment, Maximum Governance’, further developments will hold the key to attainingmore equitable economic growth. 146 Economic Survey 2022-23introduction6.1 The socio-economic milieu and unique ethos of India reside in the diverse and expansivepopulace transcending innumerable cultures, languages, and geographies, constituting thereal wealth of the country. Realising the immense potential harboured by the young andaspirational citizens spanning numerous cities and villages requires ambitious vision andmeticulous implementation, customising for the diversity of circumstances and special needsof different sections. The foundational services and structures that support society in availingvarious amenities important for a better quality of life, i.e the social infrastructure, indirectlycontributes to economic development by laying the foundation for enhancement in income andemployment opportunities, productivity growth, and technological advancement. That said,quality employment opportunities and working conditions are the essential instruments to chiselthis potential into long-term sustainable growth. In its Amrit Kaal for the next 25 years, Indiaenvisions rewarding itself with the dividends that can come from demographics.6.2 With the overall development of the economy, the concept of quality of life has enlargedto include many more elements than the traditional metrics of income (which determinethe availability of basic requirements such as food and shelter) and education levels. It nowencompasses access to clean drinking water, sanitation, employment prospects, health care,social security, connectivity, etc. All these together determine the quality of life. Researchstudies have concluded that quality of life depends upon the fulfilment of basic needs and beingable to live in an affable environment.1 Cognisant of this fact, the Government places a highpriority on the development of the social infrastructure of the country.6.3 This is all the more pertinent in the contemporary scenario as India has adopted the UNSDGs 2030, which are a set of comprehensive, far-reaching, and people-centric universal andtransformative goals and targets. Many of these seventeen goals concern the social well-beingof individuals, resolving as follows:“We resolve, between now and 2030, to end poverty and hunger everywhere; to combat inequalitieswithin and among countries; to build peaceful, just, and inclusive societies; to protect humanrights and promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; and to ensure thelasting protection of the planet and its natural resources. We resolve also to create conditionsfor sustainable, inclusive and sustained economic growth, shared prosperity and decent workfor all, taking into account different levels of national development and capacities.”26.4 The country continues to make good progress in increasing incomes and improving thestandard of living over the past decades. As detailed in the chapter, many social indicators havecontinued to improve. The years 2020 and 2021 were the peak years of the pandemic, whichtested the strength of the country’s social and health infrastructure, hampering education, lossof job opportunities, etc. Several measures were taken to meet the growing needs of the healthpandemic during this time, extending into 2022. FY23 has been a year of rejuvenation for thesector, having withered the storm of the pandemic and come out stronger. Various dimensionsof the sector are recouping lost grounds and are on the path of reenergising to meet the vision of“sabka sath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas”.1 For example: Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen, ed.

This Chapter presents emergingevidence of the achievements on these fronts. It reviews the progress on the social infrastructurefront and the enhancement of employment opportunities in the country. It covers various aspectsof the social sector, including trends in the Government’s expenditure on the social sector;the progress on the human development front; multiple measures being taken to ensure basicnecessities to all citizens; the trends in employment and education and measures to enhancethe quality of life and governance in rural areas. It dwells on various Government initiativestowards attaining different SDGs and the outcomes thereof.Social Sector expenditure Keeping pace with growing importance of the Sector6.6 The Government’s spending on social services3 has shown a rising trend since FY16with a focus on many aspects of the social well-being of citizens of the country. The share ofexpenditure on social services in the total expenditure of the Government has been around 25per cent from FY18 to FY20. It increased to 26.6 per cent in FY23 (BE). The social servicesexpenditure witnessed an increase of 8.4 per cent in FY21 over FY20 and another 31.4 percent increase in FY22 over FY21, being the pandemic years, which required enhanced outlay,especially in the health4 and education5 sectors.

The National Health Policy, 2017envisages as its goal “the attainment of the highest possible level of health and well-being forall at all ages, through a preventive and promotive healthcare orientation in all developmentalpolicies, and universal access to good quality healthcare services without anyone having toface financial hardship as a consequence. This would be achieved through increasing access,improving quality, and lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.” Accordingly, the policyrecommended an increase in the Government’s health expenditure from the existing 1.2 percent to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2025. Also, the Fifteenth Finance Commission, in its report, hadrecommended that public health expenditure of Union and States together should be increasedin a progressive manner to reach 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2025 (FFC report, para 9.41, iii). Inkeeping with this objective, Central and State Governments’ budgeted expenditure on the healthsector reached 2.1 per cent of GDP in FY23 (BE) and 2.2 per cent in FY22 (RE), against 1.6 percent in FY21.table Vi.1: trends in social services expenditure by general government(combined centre and States)(` crore)items 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 re 2022-23 betotal expenditure 3760611 4265969 4515946 5040747 5410887 6353359 7453320 8008684expenditure on Social 915500 1040620 1139524 1278124 1364906 1479389 1944013 2132059Servicesof which:Education 391881 434974 483481 526481 579575 575834 681396 757138Health 175272 213119 243388 265813 272648 317687 516427 548855Others 348348 392527 412655 485829 512683 585868 746191 826065as per cent of gdpexpenditure on Social 6.6 6.8 6.7 6.8 6.8 7.5 8.2 8.3Servicesof which:Education 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.9 2.9 2.9 2.9Health 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.6 2.2 2.1Others 2.5 2.6 2.4 2.6 2.6 3.0 3.2 3.2as per cent of total expenditureexpenditure on Social 24.3 24.4 25.2 25.4 25.2 23.3 26.1 26.6Servicesof which:Education 10.4 10.2 10.7 10.4 10.7 9.1 9.1 9.5Health 4.7 5.0 5.4 5.3 5.0 5.0 6.9 6.9Others 9.3 9.2 9.1 9.6 9.5 9.2 10.0 10.3as per cent of social serviceseducation 42.8 41.8 42.4 41.2 42.5 38.9 35.1 35.5Health 19.1 20.5 21.4 20.8 20.0 21.5 26.6 25.7others 38.0 37.7 36.2 38.0 37.6 39.6 38.4 38.7The ratios to GDP at current market prices are based on 2011-12 base till 2021-22.GDP for 2022-23 is as per Union Budget 2022-23.Sources: Budget Documents of Union and State Governments. Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 149improving Human development parameters6.8 ‘Human Development’ is the key enabler for upward social mobility. The challengesposed by the aftermath of the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and the ensuingRussia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 have impacted the development trajectory of India and theworld. In the wake of these developments, there was a global decline in human development.According to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, 90 per cent of countrieshave registered a reduction in their Human Development Index (HDI)6 value in 2020 or 2021,indicating that human development across the world has stalled for the first time in 32 years.India ranked 132 out of 191 countries and territories in the 2021/2022 HDI report7. India’sHDI value of 0.633 in 2021 places the country in the medium human development category,lower than its value of 0.645 in 2019. However, India’s HDI value continues to exceed SouthAsia’s8 average human development. It has been steadily increasing and moving towards theworld average since 1990 due to priority placed on investment in social infrastructure, includingensuring universal health and education.6.9 On the parameter of gender inequality, India’s Gender Inequality Index (GII)9 value is0.490 in 2021 and is ranked 122. This score is better than that of the South Asian region (value:0.508) and close to the world average of 0.465. This reflects the Government’s initiativesand investments towards more inclusive growth, social protection, and gender-responsivedevelopment policies.

It is calculated using 4 indicators – life expectancyat birth, mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, and the GNI per capita.7 Released on 8 September 2022 and provides ranking for the year 2021.8 South Asia includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka9 The index measures inequality in achievement between women and men in three dimensions, viz. reproductive health, empowerment, andthe labour market. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimen-sions. The value of GIII ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measureddimensions. 150 Economic Survey 2022-23box Vi.1: undp multidimensional poverty index 2022Generally, poverty is primarily measured in terms of lack of monetary means for a decent living.However, by definition ‘poverty’ has wider implications and leads to multiple disadvantages at thesame time – such as poor health or malnutrition, lack of sanitation, clean drinking water or electricity,poor quality of education etc. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capturethe reality of poverty.Multidimensional poverty measures are hence used to create a more comprehensive picture. It revealswho is poor and how they are poor and the range of different deprivations experienced by them.One such measure is the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) global MultidimensionalPoverty Index (MPI) which measures acute multidimensional poverty across more than 100developing countries. The methodology involves measuring each person’s overlapping deprivationsacross 10 indicators in three equally weighted dimensions: health, education, and standard of living.The health and education dimensions are based on two indicators each, while the standard of livingis based on six indicators. All the indicators needed to construct the MPI for a country are taken fromthe same household survey. Each indicator is equally weighted within its dimension, so the health andeducation indicators are weighted 1/6 each, and the standard of living indicators are weighted 1/18each. The MPI ranges from 0 to 1, and higher values imply higher multidimensional poverty. The MPIcomplements the international US$ 1.90-a-day poverty line by identifying who is multidimensionallypoor and shows the composition of multidimensional poverty.mpi for indiaThe 2022 report of the UNDP on MPI was released in October 2022 and covers 111 developingcountries. As regards India, the survey data for 2019-21 has been used. Based on these estimates, 16.4per cent of the population in India (228.9 million people in 2020) is multidimensionally poor whilean additional 18.7per cent is classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty (260.9 millionpeople in 2020). The intensity of deprivation in India, which is the average deprivation score amongpeople living in multidimensional poverty, is 42 per cent. The MPI value, which is the share of thepopulation that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations, is 0.069.Percentage of people in Number of MultidimensionallyMultidimensional Poverty Poor people in Crores6555.13727.72316.42005-2006 2015-2016 2019-2021 2005-2006 2015-2016 2019-2021Source: UNDP Report on Multidimensional Poverty, 2022 Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 151The report also compares multidimensional poverty with monetary poverty measured by the percentageof the population living below the 2011 PPP of US$1.90 per day. It shows that monetary poverty doesnot present the complete picture. The headcount or incidence of multidimensional poverty is 6.1percentage points lower than the incidence of monetary poverty. This implies that individuals livingbelow the monetary poverty line may have access to non-income resources.The findings of the report suggest that in India, 41.5 crore people exited poverty between 2005-06and 2019-21, demonstrating that the SDG target 1.2 of reducing at least by half the proportion ofmen, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to nationaldefinitions by 2030 is possible to achieve.The poorest states and groups (children, lower castes and those living in rural areas) reduced povertythe fastest in absolute terms, although the data do not reflect post-Covid-19 pandemic changes.Among the multidimensionally poor, deprivation prevalence declined across deprivation categories.1.128.112.2 5.16.117.75.59.3629.314.423.117.57.26.81.25.326.315.96.5302520151050tnecrepnoitirtun ytilatromdlihcfosraeygniloohcsloohcsecnadnetta leufgnikoocnoitatinas retawgniknirdyticirtcele gnisuoh stessaPercentage of people multimensionally poor and deprived of eachindicator2015-2016 2019-2021Cting an example of how things are changing at the ground level, Dr. Sundipto Mundle, Chairman,Centre for Development Studies, in a newspaper article “Villages at the periphery and the changingface of backwardness”, Live Mint, 24 November 2022, informs about his visit to four backwardvillages in Jharkhand, and reports about considerable progress in physical infrastructure such asroads, houses, digital connectivity, adequate irrigation facilities, Public Distribution System (PDS),education facilities etc. With the intervention of the State and the general market development,extreme deprivation and hunger have been eliminated in these villages.10transformation of aspirational districts programme6.10 The Government of India launched the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’(Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP)) initiative in January 2018 with a vision of a NewIndia by 2022 wherein the focus is to raise living standards of its citizens and ensuring inclusivegrowth of all in the burgeoning economy. The districts are prodded and encouraged first to catchup with the best district of their state, and subsequently aspire to become one of the best in the10 https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/villages-at-the-periphery-and-the-changing-face-of-backwardness-11669313591060.html 152 Economic Survey 2022-23country, by competing with and learning from others in the spirit of competitive and cooperativefederalism.6.11 117 Aspirational Districts (ADs) across 28 States/UTs have been identified by NITI Aayogbased upon composite indicators ranging from health and nutrition, education, agriculture, andwater resources, financial inclusion and skill development, and basic infrastructure which havean impact on HDI. The broad contours of the programme are Convergence (of Central & StateSchemes), Collaboration (of Central, State level Nodal Officers & District Collectors), andCompetition among districts through monthly delta ranking; all driven by a mass movement.6.12 With States as the main drivers, this programme focuses on the strength of each district,identifying low-hanging fruits for immediate improvement and measuring progress by rankingdistricts every month. The ranking is based on the incremental progress made across 49 KeyPerformance Indicators (KPI) under five broad socio-economic themes mentioned above.6.13 NITI Aayog has developed a broad template for the formulation of district plans. Sincedifferent districts have different opportunities and challenges, they have been advised tocustomise the template. A primer comprising steps to be taken to improve each of the indicators,compiled from the inputs received from respective Ministries, has also been developed with thehelp of Central Ministries and the States and shared with district administration.6.14 Achievements of the programme(a) Many ADs have surpassed the average state values in several indicators under the Healthand Nutrition theme monitored under the programme. For instance, in 10 indicators ofhealth, 73 ADs have surpassed the state averages.(b) The programme monitors progress across five focus sectors. All districts have madesignificant improvements across different indicators for instance, under Health andNutrition, 46 districts have improved by up to 45 per cent, and 23 districts have improvedby up to 69 per cent in critical indicators related to pregnant women’s health which havea bearing on the Maternal and Infant Mortality Rates such as frequency and coverageof antenatal care check-ups; regularity of supplementary nutrition intake by pregnantwomen, and timely Anaemia detection and treatment rate. Under education, 46 districtshave improved by up to 34 per cent, and 29 districts have improved by up to 49 percent in critical indicators which affect learning outcomes attained by students such as thepercentage of elementary schools complying with Right to Education Act, 2009 (RTE)specified Pupil-Teacher Ratio; percentage of schools with functional drinking waterfacility and percentage of schools with functional girls’ toilets.(c) While monitoring the outcome of financial inclusion, it was seen that ADs have performedbetter than non-aspirational districts. This means more people have access to bank accounts,more have been covered under the fold of government insurance schemes and more cansecure MUDRA loans in ADs.(d) Several ADs have reported saturation in the basic infrastructure indicators like thepercentage of households with electricity connection; percentage of habitations with Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 153access to all-weather roads under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY);cumulative number of kilometres of all-weather road work completed as a percentage oftotal sanctioned kilometres in the district under PMGSY; and percentage of householdswith individual household washrooms, etc.Template of Good Governance6.15 The ADP has emerged as a template for good governance, especially in remote anddifficult areas. At present, two programmes have been conceptualised along the lines of ADPdesign, one is ‘Mission Utkarsh’ and the other is ‘Aspirational Blocks Programme’ (ABP). On22 January 2022, ‘Mission Utkarsh’ was launched, under which 15 Central Ministries, havingan interface with the public, have identified their low performing 10-15 districts. Followingthe ADP template, the Ministries have launched actions to bring these districts at par with anaverage district in the state in one year and close to the all-India average in another.6.16 The Central Government and States have come together to use the ADP template toidentify backward blocks and use similar data monitoring and competition-based programmeto improve the most under-developed blocks in the country. In order to further strengthen thisinitiative, 500 most backward blocks across States and UTs have been identified for rapiddevelopment.progressing labour reform measures6.17 In 2019 and 2020, 29 Central Labour Laws were amalgamated, rationalised, andsimplified into four Labour Codes, viz., the Code on Wages, 2019 (August 2019), the IndustrialRelations Code, 2020, the Code on Social Security, 2020, and the Occupational Safety, Health &Working Conditions Code, 2020 (September 2020). The new laws are in tune with the changinglabour market trends and, at the same time, accommodate the minimum wage requirement andwelfare needs of the unorganised sector workers, including the self-employed and migrantworkers, within the legislation framework. The Labour Codes have been aligned with the presenteconomic scenario and technological advancements along with reduction in multiplicity ofdefinitions and authorities. The Codes also ease compliance mechanism aiming to promote easeof doing business/setting up of enterprises and catalyse creation of employment opportunitieswhile ensuring safety, health and social security of every worker. Use of technology, such as,web-based Inspection has been introduced in order to ensure transparency and accountability inenforcement.

It connects the Government and the individual,replacing the disentangled web of multiple IDs for multiple purposes, and secures the socialcontract between the State and the Citizen. It is because of the initiative taken in 2010 that today,the nation is consistently building and strengthening a digital economy which will ultimatelygive a global competitive advantage in how money and goods move around the country over itscompetitors.6.22 Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate and former World Bank Chief Economist, has describedwhat 135 crore citizens of India, which is 94 per cent of the population and 100 per cent ofthe adult (>18 years), have as “the most sophisticated ID programme in the world.”11 Aadhaarprovides a conclusive connection between the photograph of the Aadhaar holder, his/herfingerprints, and iris scan details.achievements of aadhaar6.23 Aadhaar is an essential tool for social delivery by the State. 318 Central schemes andover 720 state DBT schemes are notified under section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and allthese schemes use Aadhaar for targeted delivery of financial services, subsidies, and benefits.Aadhaar is the foundation of India’s digital integration, as shown by the following statistics (asof November 2022):• Aadhaar Generated- 135.2 crore11 “'Adhaar' most sophisticated ID programme in the world: World Bank”. Daiji World, Quoted from an interview with Bloomberg. 156 Economic Survey 2022-23• Aadhaar Updated- 71.1 crore• Authentication Done- 8621.2 crore• eKYC Done-1350.2 crore• 75.3 crore residents have linked their Aadhaar with ration cards to avail of ration• 27.9 crore residents linked Aadhaar with cooking gas connection for LPG subsidy• 75.4 crore bank accounts are linked with Aadhaar & 1549.8 crore transactions via AadhaarEnabled Payment Systems6.24 The key usages of Aadhaar in the daily lives of citizens are:• Aadhaar – Usage in DBT: When linked with a bank account, an Aadhaar becomes the‘Financial Address’ of an individual, which helps to accomplish the country’s goal offinancial inclusion. The number is sufficient to transfer any payment to an individual’s bankaccount through Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB), thus eliminating the need to give otherdetails, viz. the bank account, IFSC Code, and bank branch details to the Government/Institutions.• Aadhaar Enabled Payment Systems (AEPS): AEPS helps an individual to do basic bankingtransactions, viz. withdrawal, cash deposit, transfer of funds from his bank account, etc.,by simply using his Aadhaar. This has immensely facilitated providing door-step bankingservices and helped mitigate the hardships of the people due to the Covid-19 pandemic.• JAM (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile) trinity, combined with the power of DBT, hasbrought the marginalised sections of society into the formal financial system, revolutionisingthe path of transparent and accountable governance by empowering the people. Till November2022, multiple large central schemes, including PAHAL, MGNREGS, etc., have paid over`7,66,055.9 crore through over 1,010 crore successful transactions.12• One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) Scheme: Aadhaar has played a key role in theimplementation of the ONORC Scheme. While Aadhaar seeding of the PDS databasehas resulted in significant savings due to eliminating ghost and duplicate beneficiaries.Grain disbursal through Aadhaar-based Biometric Authentication has brought meaningfultransparency and back-office improvement of the logistic network of PDS. Free distributionof food grains under ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana’ (PMGKY) has greatly mitigatedthe Covid pandemic’s impact, especially for the weakest and most vulnerable sections ofsociety.• PM Kisan Samman Nidhi: Aadhaar platform forms the backbone for the implementation ofthis scheme, right from registration through Aadhaar eKYC to DBT through the APB.• Co-WIN: Successful management of the Covid pandemic without the Co-WIN platformwould not have been possible. Aadhaar played a vital role in developing the Co-WINplatform and in the transparent administration of over 2 billion vaccine doses.12 Source: National Payments Coporation of India. Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 157• Face Authentication: The use of face as an additional modality of authentication isincreasing. This has helped, especially the elderly, to get ‘Jeevan Praman’ through theirsmartphones to avail of pension.the aadhaar ecosystem6.25 The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is mandated to develop thepolicy, procedure, and system for issuing an Aadhaar number to each resident individual andperforming authentication. It also has the responsibility to take necessary measures to ensurethat the information stored in the Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) is secured andprotected against unauthorised access or misuse. The ecosystem required for the purpose nowconsists of the following (as of 30 November 2022):• 66,103 Aadhaar counters and 34,834 Child Enrolment Lite Client devices are functional• 180 Active Registrars• 507 Active Enrolment Agencies• UIDAI run 88 Aadhaar Sewa Kendra are functional in 72 cities• 15,002 Village Level Entrepreneurs operational as Banking Correspondents permitted toundertake Aadhaar updates services• Around 53,750 postmen/Grameen Dak Sewaks under India Post Payment Bank have beenapproved to provide mobile number update facility• 178Aadhaar User Agencies• 169 e-KYC user agenciesimproving employment trends6.26 Employment trends can be studied from the supply side of labour through householdsurveys such as the PLFS conducted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation(MoSPI), and the demand side of labour through enterprise or establishment surveys such as theAnnual Survey of Industries (ASI) by MoSPI, Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) by LabourBureau, etc. These enable a complete view of the labour market and the trends therein.6.27 The broad-based improvement in employment indicators can be observed in data coveringboth the supply side and demand side of the labour market. Labour markets have recoveredbeyond pre-Covid levels, in both urban and rural areas, with unemployment rates falling from5.8 per cent in 2018-19 to 4.2 per cent in 2020-21, and a noticeable rise in rural FLFPR from19.7 per cent in 2018-19 to 27.7 per cent in 2020-21. More recent urban employment data showsprogress beyond pre-pandemic levels as the unemployment rate declined from 8.3 per cent inJuly-September 2019 to 7.2 per cent in July-September 2022.The net addition to EPFO payroll is steadily moving upward, with the majority share comingfrom the youth. Employment in nine major sectors has increased by 10 lakh over the year2021-22 as per the QES. Employment in the organised manufacturing sector has also beenrising over the years, as per the ASI 2019-20 data. The steady increase in employment levelscan be attributed to multiple measures taken to cushion the impact of Covid-19 on MSMEs, 158 Economic Survey 2022-23street vendors, and manufacturing units and provide job opportunities through various targetedschemes and measures as detailed in later in the chapter.

As per CWS, labour market indicatorsrecovered swiftly from 2019-20 (July-June) to 2020-21, and for both males and females, withimprovement in employment indicators. Region-wise, while rural labour market indicators havebeen improving for both males and females, the urban labour market is slightly behind pre-Covidlevels in 2020-21 (July-June). However, taking a cue from the Quarterly PLFS reports for urbanareas available for more recent quarters, the recovery of urban labour markets beyond pre-Covidlevels is discernible. Quarterly urban unemployment rate declined from pre-pandemic level13 For a person to be categorised as employed as per usual status (ps+ss), he/she must have pursued an economic activity for at least 30 daysduring the 365 days preceding the date of the survey.14 According to the PLFS, LFPR is the percentage of working-age population engaged in work or making tangible efforts to seek ‘work’ or be-ing available for ‘work’ if it is available. ‘Work’ includes self-employment (subsistence agriculture and collection of firewood, poultry farming,etc, for self-consumption), regular wage/salaried employment, and casual labour.15 WPR is defined as the per centage of employed persons in the total population.16 UR is defined as the per centage of unemployed persons in the labour force.17 This is the lastest available annual survey released in June, 2022.18 For a person to be categorised as employed as per current weekly status, he/she must have pursued an economic activity for at least 1 hourduring the seven days preceding the date of survey.

Measurement of employment through the surveydesign and content can make a significant difference to final LFPR estimates, and this matters morefor measuring female LFPR than male LFPR. Here, three main measurement issues have beenhighlighted: overly broad categories, reliance on a single question to categorize labour force status,and the narrow approach of limiting productive work to labour force participation.use of overly broad categories clubbing productive work (collection of firewood, poultryfarming, etc.) with domestic duties can in one sweep shift a significant proportion of women in thelabour force into the out-of- labour-force category. For example, unless the production of primarygoods is identified as the main activity by the respondent, the PLFS questionnaire would categorizewomen who do both domestic activities and primary goods production/collection into ‘Activity Code93,19 and thus out-of-the-labour-force.19 In the NSSO survey questionnaires, activity status codes are assigned to each household member, according to their primary activity under-taken. Activity code 93 refers to “engaged in domestic duties and also engaged in free collection of goods (vegetable, firewood, cattle feed,etc.), tailoring, etc. for household use”. Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 161Adding the proportion of women in Activity code 93 to the official LFPR yields an “AugmentedFemale LFPR” of 46.2 per cent for FY21 for ages 15 years and above, much higher than the 32.5per cent estimated by the conventional definition (PLFS data for usual status). A similar attempt hasbeen made in an International Labour Organization (ILO) research paper20, arriving at a female LFPRof 56.4 per cent in India for 2012, against the far lower official estimate of 31.2 per cent for 2012.70605046.24032.530201001999-00 2004-05 2009-10 2011-12 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21tnecrepFemale LFPR: Rural + UrbanOfficial AugmentedSource: NSS Employment Unemployment Survey (NSS-EUS) for 1999-00 to 2011-12, PLFS from2017-18 to 2011-12.Augmented FLPR calculations estimated using NSO dataNote: 1. Usual activity (ps+ss) status (for age group 15 years & above) in per cent2. NSS-EUS and PLFS may not be comparable, given different sampling weights, frequencies,and data collection techniques.no recovery questions in the plfS questionnaire: The survey design relies mainly on a singlequestion for measuring the labour force status of an individual, which eliminates the scope to rectifyany error in self-reporting, considering the large rural population and literacy levels. Contrary to ILOrecommendations, there are no additional questions (‘recovery questions’) in the PLFS questionnaireto double-check individuals’ labour force status, relying too much on how the individual self-identifiesin the first instance. ILO recommends using multiple probing or recovery questions such as “whetherthe person helped in the family business” and “whether the person worked in own business in last oneweek/year” and “whether person helped the family with job”.In a World Bank and ILO study in Sri Lanka21, such methodological issues accounted for close toeight percentage point underestimation of the female employment-to-population ratio.measurement of “Work” alongside “employment”: There is a need to broaden the horizon ofmeasuring work, which constitutes the whole universe of productive activities alongside employment.According to the latest ILO standards22, limiting productive work to labour force participation is20 Kapsos, S., Bourmpola, E., Silberman, A. (2014), “Why is female labour participation rate declining so sharply in India?”, ILO ResearchPaper No. 1021 Discenza, A., Gaddis, I., Palacios-Lopez, A., Walsh, K. (2021). Measuring Women and Men’s Work: Main Findings from a Joint ILO andWorld Bank Study in Sri Lanka.22 The 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 2013 adopted a new set of norms to expand the set of productive activities classi-fied as ‘work’, comprising any activity performed by persons of any sex and age to produce goods or to provide services for use by others or forown use. The definition of work is aligned with the General production boundary as defined in the System of National Accounts 2008, includingown use production work and volunteer work. 162 Economic Survey 2022-23narrow and only measures work as a market product. It does not include the value of women’sunpaid domestic work, which can be seen as expenditure-saving work such as collecting firewood,cooking, tutoring children, etc, and contributes significantly to the household’s standard of living.Thus, a wholesome measurement of “work” may require improved quantification through redesignedsurveys.That said, there is further significant scope to nullify the gender-based disadvantages to enablefree choice of women to join the labour market. Ecosystem services, including affordable creches,career counselling/handholding, lodging and transportation, etc., can further help unlock the genderdividend for inclusive and broad-based growth.6.32 It may be noted that more than 75 per cent of rural female workers are employed inthe agricultural sector. This implies a need to upskill and create employment for women inagriculture-related sectors such as food processing. Here, the self-help groups (SHGs) can playa crucial role in shaping rural women’s potential into concrete developmental outcomes offinancial inclusion, livelihood diversification, and skill development as discussed in Box VI.3.box Vi.3: role of Self-Help groups in Women’s empowermentThe Self-Help Groups (SHGs)23 movement, based on the principles of group solidarity andmicrofinance, has existed in India for 50 years in one form or another, with its roots tracing back tothe formation of the Self-Employed Women’s Association in 1972. The transformative potential ofSHGs, exemplified through their key role in the on-ground response to Covid-19, has served as thefulcrum of rural development through women empowerment.India has around 1.2 crore SHGs, 88 per cent being all-women SHGs. Success stories includeKudumbashree in Kerala, Jeevika in Bihar, Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahila Mandal in Maharashtra, andrecently, Looms of Ladakh.The SHG Bank Linkage Project (SHG-BLP), launched in 1992, has blossomed into the world’slargest microfinance project. The SHG movement, now in its 30th year, has emerged as a powerfulintervention to cover the small and marginalised sections. Currently, bank-linked SHGs are promotedthrough Central Government, State Governments, NGOs, etc. They must practice the ‘Panchasutra’of regular meetings, regular savings, regular inter-loaning, timely repayment and up-to-date books ofaccounts to avail of loans from banks. With the active collaboration of stakeholders, the SHG-BLPcovers 14.2 crore families through 119 lakh SHGs with savings deposits of `47,240.5 crore and 67lakh groups with collateral-free loans outstanding of `1,51,051.3 crore, as on 31 March 2022. Thenumber of SHGs credit linked has grown at a CAGR of 10.8 per cent during the last ten years (FY13to FY22), while credit disbursement per SHG has grown at a CAGR of 5.7 per cent during the sameperiod. Notably, SHGs’ bank repayment is more than 96 per cent, underscoring their credit disciplineand reliability.23 A SHG is a socially and economically homogenous group of up to 20 persons, formed voluntarily for the collective purpose of savings andcredit, with no insistence on collateral for loans and end usage of credit.

They emerged as pivotalplayers in crisis management, leading from the front in - producing masks (with cultural variantssuch as Gamusa Masks in Assam), sanitisers, and protective gear, creating awareness about thepandemic (e.g. Patrakar Didis of Jharkhand), delivering essential goods (e.g. Floating supermarketsin Kerala), running community kitchens (e.g. Prerna Canteens in Uttar Pradesh), supporting farmlivelihoods (e.g. Pashu Sakhis for animal health care services, Aajeevika Farm Fresh Online sellingand distribution mechanism for vegetables in Jharkhand), convergence with MGNREGS (in UP,Bihar, Chhattisgarh), and in delivery of financial services (e.g. Bank Sakhis managing bank rush foravailing Covid-relief DBT cash transfers). The production of masks by SHGs has been a noteworthycontribution, enabling access to and use of masks by communities in remote rural areas and providingvital protection against the Covid-19 virus. As on 4 January 2023, more than 16.9 crore masks wereproduced by SHGs under DAY-NRLM.Way forwardSHGs are well-placed to facilitate overall rural development owing to their access to the last mile,ability to draw on communities’ trust and solidarity, knowledge of local dynamics, and ability toswiftly manufacture simple products and services through the aggregation of members’ economicactivities. The demonstration of their resilience and flexibility during crises, including Covid, needsto be thus regularised for long-run rural transformation. This includes, among other things, addressinginter-regional disparity in the deepening of the SHG movement, graduating SHG members intomicro-entrepreneurs, culturally contextualised skill development for moving up the value chain inproducts and services, and including the least privileged under the SHG umbrella.Quarterly plfS for urban areas6.33 The PLFS conducted by the MoSPI at a quarterly level for urban areas is available tillJuly-September 2022. The data shows an improvement in all the key labour market indicatorsin the quarter ending September 2022 both sequentially and over the last year, as per the CWS.The labour participation rate increased to 47.9 per cent in July-September 2022 from 46.9 percent a year ago, while the worker-population ratio strengthened from 42.3 per cent to 44.5 percent in the same period. The unemployment rate declined from 9.8 per cent in July-September2021 to 7.2 per cent in July-September 2022.This trend highlights that the labour markets haverecovered from the Covid impact.

These nine sectorsaccount for around 83 per cent of the total employment in establishments with ten or moreworkers as per the 6th Economic Census (2013-14) conducted by MoSPI.6.36 So far, results of four rounds of the QES have been released, covering four quarters ofFY22.28 The estimated total employment in the nine selected sectors according to the fourthround of QES (January to March 2022) stood at 3.2 crore, which is nearly ten lakh higherthan the estimated employment from the first round of QES (April-June 2021). The increase inestimates of workers from Q1FY22 to Q4FY22 was driven by rising employment in sectors suchas IT/BPO (by 17.6 lakh), health (7.8 lakh), and education (1.7 lakh), due to rising digitisationand resurgence of services sector economy.6.37 Regarding terms of employment, regular employees constituted the majority of workersacross sectors, with a share of 86.4 per cent in the total workforce in Q4FY22. Contractualemployees formed a relatively small proportion of the workforce in these nine sectors, exceptManufacturing (12.4 per cent) and Construction (19.0 per cent). Further, out of the total employed28 The latest Report on Fourth Round (January-March, 2022) of QES was released in September 2022. 166 Economic Survey 2022-23in the fourth round of QES, 98.0 per cent are employees while 1.9 per cent are self-employed.Gender-wise, 31.8 per cent of the total estimated employed are women and 68.2 per cent aremen.

In terms of share of employment (total persons engaged)30, the food products industry(11.1 per cent) remained the largest employer, followed by wearing apparel (7.6 per cent), basicmetals (7.3 per cent), and motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers (6.5 per cent). State-wise,Tamil Nadu had the largest number of persons engaged in factories (26.6 lakh), followed byGujarat (20.7 lakh), Maharashtra (20.4 lakh), Uttar Pradesh (11.3 lakh), and Karnataka (10.8lakh).29 The results of ASI 2019-20 were released in 2022.30 Total Persons Engaged include the employees as defined above and all working proprietors and their family members who are actively en-gaged in the work of the factory even without any pay, and the unpaid members of the co-operative societies who worked in or for the factoryin any direct and productive capacity. 168 Economic Survey 2022-23 udaNlimaTtarajuG arthsarahaM hsedarPrattUakatanraK anayraH anagnaleT lagneBtseWhsedarParhdnAbajnuP nahtsajaR dnahkarattU hsedarPayhdaMalareK ahsidO massA hragsittahC hsedarPlahcamiHdnahkrahJ ilevaHN&ardaDrahiB uiD&namaDihleDSource: ASI, MoSPINote: States/UTs with at least one lakh total persons engaged in factory sector have been shown in the chart.6.40 In terms of employment size, the data shows a skewed distribution of a larger numberof factories with low employment sizes and a few factories with higher employment sizes. Forexample, out of an estimated 1,98,628 factories in operation, 1,34,577 factories are found toemploy less than 50 employees each. However, the distribution of persons engaged is morebalanced and right-skewed, with larger factories accounting for a greater share of employment.For instance, 77.3 per cent of the total persons engaged are in factories engaging more than100 persons. Over time, there is a visible trend towards bigger factories employing more than100 workers, their numbers rising by 12.7 per cent from FY17 to FY20, compared to a broadlyconstant number of smaller factories. Between FY17 and FY20, total persons engaged in largerfactories rose by 13.7 per cent, compared to 4.6 per cent in smaller factories. Resultantly, theshare of larger factories in the total number of factories has increased from 18 per cent in FY17to 19.8 per cent in FY20, and their share in total persons engaged shows a similar expansionfrom 75.8 per cent in FY17 to 77.3 per cent in FY20. Thus, in terms of total persons engaged,employment has been rising in larger factories (employing more than 100 workers) than insmaller ones, suggesting scaling up of manufacturing units. 4-002999-0059991-00019994-0002&0005evobaDistribution of Factories and Persons Engaged by Employment RangeFactories in Operation Total Persons EngagedEmployment Range Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 169120100806040200Factory size less than Factory size more than100 100hkalnisrebmunWorkers by Employment Size ofFactories2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20140120100806040200Factory size less than 100 Factory size more than100hkalnisrebmunTotal Persons Engaged by EmploymentSize of Factories2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20Source: ASI, MoSPIformal employment6.41 Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of theGovernment. Following this path, the organised sector job market conditions measured by payrolldata for Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and Employees’ State InsuranceCorporation (ESIC) reveal the benefits of the government initiatives towards improvement inthe labour market. EPFO data indicates a consistent YoY increase in payroll addition, pointingtowards improved formalisation as economic activities picked up. The net addition in EPFsubscriptions during FY22 was 58.7 per cent higher than in FY21 and 55.7 per cent higher thanthat in the pre-pandemic year 2019. In FY23, net average monthly subscribers added underEPFO increased from 8.8 lakh in April-November 2021 to 13.2 lakh in April-November 2022.6.42 The swift rebound of formal sector payroll addition can be attributed to the AatmanirbharBharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY), launched in October 2020 to boost the economy, increase theemployment generation in post Covid-19 recovery phase, and to incentivise creation of newemployment along with social security benefits and restoration of employment lost during thepandemic.

One such measure is the National Career Service(NCS) project, which is detailed in Box VI.4. Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 173box Vi.4: national career Service projectThe ‘National Career Service (NCS’)project was launched in July 2015, as a one-stop solutionproviding an array of employment and career-related services. It works towards bridging the gapbetween candidates and employers; candidates seeking training and career guidance and agenciesproviding training and career counselling. NCS portal has a job fair module to streamline the processof job fair activity on a single online platform by engaging all stakeholders i.e. model career centres,nodal officers, job seekers and employers. It is also supported by a dedicated helpline (multi-lingual)for assisting users.As on 5 January 2023, 2.8 crore jobseekers and 6.8 lakh employers have registered in NCS portal,2.5 lakh active vacancies and 1.2 crore total vacancies have been mobilised, and more than 9,100 jobfairs have been organised as part of the Project.NCS has partnered with private sector under DigiSaksham programme to offer a free, self-pacedOnline/Offline Training Programme on “Career Skills”, to equip the jobseekers with an array of softand digital skills with the mandate of improving their employability. This programme also includesadvanced computing areas and is being provided free of cost.NCS is also working closely with Ministry of Education All India Council for Technical Education andAll India Survey of Higher Education ) to ensure that its benefits are reaching to prospective students/candidates. Online integration with EPFO and ESIC has also been done to link the willing employersfor enabling them to shortlist right candidates through a countrywide database of workforce on NCSportal. NCS has also integrated with DigiLocker to enable candidates to upload their documents/certificates and make them available to the employers to quicken the hiring process.As per budget announcement of 2022-23, NCS portal has been successfully interlinked withe-Shram, Udyam and Skill India portal (primary data source of ASEEM portal). This has resulted indevelopment of an employment ecosystem to facilitate job search and matching for both jobseekersand employers. So far, more than 10 lakh candidates from e-Shram have registered on NCS out ofwhich, more than 1.2 lakh candidates have been shortlisted by employers for jobs. More than 46 lakhskilled candidates of Skill India portal have been registered on NCS through data exchange. Thesecandidates can showcase their skills to the prospective employers, thus enhancing their opportunity toget a job. Integration between Udyam and NCS has facilitated more than 4,76,650 MSME employersin getting seamless registration on NCS portal.NCS has recently added ‘International Job’ module on the portal in March 2022, which facilitatesemployers registered with the Ministry of External Affairs to post international job opportunities onthe NCS portal and the jobseekers to search and apply for these opportunities via the NCS portal.

In agriculture, the YoY rate of growth of nominal wage rates in agriculture was 5.1 percent for men and 7.5 per cent for women, during the period April-November 2022. In non- 174 Economic Survey 2022-23agricultural activities, the growth of nominal wage rates was 4.7 per cent for men and 3.7 percent for women, during the same period. However, growth in real rural wages has been negativedue to elevated inflation. Going forward, as inflation is expected to soften with the easing ofinternational commodity prices and domestic food prices, it is expected that this will translateinto a rise in real wages. 5032530027525022520002-yaM 02-luJ 02-peS 02-voN 12-naJ 12-raM 12-yaM 12-luJ 12-peS 12-voN 22-naJ 22-raM 22-yaM 22-luJ 22-peS 22-voN425400375350Men Women 32530027525022520002-yaM 02-luJ 02-peS 02-voN 12-naJ 12-raM 12-yaM 12-luJ 12-peS 12-voN 22-naJ 22-raM 22-yaM 22-luJ 22-peS 22-voNMen WomenReal Rural Wage: Agriculture Real Rural Wage: Non-Agriculture25022520017515012502-yaM 02-luJ 02-peS 02-voN 12-naJ 12-raM 12-yaM 12-luJ 12-peS 12-voN 22-naJ 22-raM 22-yaM 22-luJ 22-peS 22-voN275250225Men Women 20017515012502-yaM 02-luJ 02-peS 02-voN 12-naJ 12-raM 12-yaM 12-luJ 12-peS 12-voN 22-naJ 22-raM 22-yaM 22-luJ 22-peS 22-voNMen WomenSource: Monthly Rural Wage Rates by Labour Bureau33ensuring Quality education for all6.49 The importance of education for all cannot be overemphasised as it is the foundation ofevery individual and society’s development. As remarked by Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam – ‘Learninggives creativity, creativity leads to thinking, thinking leads to knowledge, and knowledge makesyou great !’6.50 Education, apart from enhancing the employability of the working-age population, alsohas an equalising impact in breaking the cycles of poverty and social marginalisation. “Quality33 http://labourbureaunew.gov.in/showdetail.aspx?pr_id=iBJEgR8%2bUFY%3d Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 175Education” which is enlisted as Goal 4 under UN SDGs (SDG4), aims to “Ensure inclusive andequitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030. Thisgoal is of critical importance because of the transformative effects that it can have on most otherSDGs, such as “no poverty”, “zero hunger”, “gender equality” etc. Sustainable development,in fact, hinges on every child receiving quality education, offering them the tools to develop totheir full potential and become productive citizens aiding their own socioeconomic progress andthat of their nation.6.51 It is in this context that the NEP 2020 was laid down as the first education policy of the21st century, aiming to address the many growing developmental imperatives of the country.Recognising that education is the lifeblood of human capital formation for a young countrylike India, this policy provided for the revision and revamping of all aspects of the educationstructure. This includes its regulation and governance, creation of a new system that is alignedwith the aspirational goals of 21st century-education, including SDG4, while building uponIndia’s traditions and value systems. The NEP provides for nurturing all-around developmentand skill acquisition by youth in an inclusive, accessible, and multilingual set-up.6.52 As part of the whole-of-ecosystem approach, the Union Government launched SamagraShiksha in 2018 as an overarching programme for the school education sector extending frompre-school to class XII with an aim to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at alllevels of school education.School enrolment6.53 The year FY22 saw improvement in Gross Enrolment Ratios (GER)34 in schools andimprovement in gender parity.

These include Kerala (19), Maharashtra (33), Telangana(43) Andhra Pradesh (45), Tamil Nadu (54), Jharkhand (56), Gujarat (57), and Karnataka (69).6.81 Following a steady downward trend, Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Under Five MortalityRate (U5MR) and Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) have further declined as a result of countrywideefforts towards increasing health service coverage through strengthening of service delivery;quality assurance; RMNCAH+N; human resources, community processes; information andknowledge; drugs and diagnostics, and supply chain management, etc.table Vi.18: trends in mortality indicators2014 2016 2018 2020Maternal Mortality Ratio (per lakh live births) 167 130 113 97(2011-13) (2014-16) (2016-18) (2018-20)Infant Mortality Rate (per 1000 live births) 39 34 32 28Neonatal Mortality Rate (per 1000 live births) 26 24 23 20Under 5 Mortality Rate (per 1000 live births) 45 39 36 32Early Neonatal Mortality Rate – 0- 7 days (per 20 18 18 151000 live births)Source: Sample Registration SystemHealth expenditure estimates6.82 National Health Account (NHA)38 for the year FY19 (which is the latest available account)highlights the rising importance of public healthcare and social security in ensuring universalhealth coverage. The NHA estimates for FY19 show that there has been an increase in the shareof Government Health Expenditure (GHE) 39 in the total GDP from 1.2 per cent in FY14 to 1.3per cent in FY19. Additionally, the share of GHE in Total Health Expenditure (THE)40 has alsoincreased over time, standing at 40.6 per cent in FY19, substantially higher than 28.6 per centin FY14.38 NHA estimates for India 2018-19 is the sixth consecutive NHA estimates report prepared by NHSRC, designated as National Health Ac-counts Technical Secretariat in 2014 by the Union Health Ministry.

Current Health Expenditure (CHE)41 is `5,40,246 crore (90.6 per centof THE) and capital expenditures is `56,194 crore (9.4 per cent of THE). Of the GHE, UnionGovernment’s share is 34.3 per cent and the State Governments’ share is 65.7 per cent.6.84 Aligning with the focus on providing healthcare services to all, which comprises one ofthe policy recommendations of the National Health Policy 2017, the Government is focusingon primary healthcare expenditure which has increased from 51.1 per cent in FY14 to 55.2 percent in FY19. This not only ensures quality services at the grassroot level but also reduces thechances of ailments requiring secondary or tertiary healthcare services. Between FY14 andFY19, the share of primary and secondary care in the GHE increased from 74.4 per cent to 85.7per cent. On the other hand, share of primary and secondary care in private health expenditurehas declined from 82.0 per cent to 70.2 per cent during the same period.6.85 The social security expenditure on health, which includes the social health insuranceprogramme, government-financed health insurance schemes, and medical reimbursements madeto government employees, has increased from 6 per cent in FY14 to 9.6 per cent in FY19. Thisis a significant increase which shows that the citizens are better equipped and better provided interms of healthcare at their doorstep making it more accessible. Due to several such steps, Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE)42 as a percentage of THE has declined substantially from 64.2per cent in FY14 to 48.2 per cent in FY19.

Public health infrastructure has been referredto as ‘the nerve centre of the public health system’, forming the basic support system for thelast-mile delivery of public health services. Alongside, human resources for health are identifiedas one of the core building blocks of the health system. These include physicians, nursingprofessionals, pharmacists, midwives, dentists, allied health professionals, community healthworkers, social health workers and other health care providers, as well as health managementand support personnel.6.87 The recent health sector reforms in India have laid emphasis on strengthening healthinfrastructure as well as human resource in the public sector system. This can be observed in therise in the number of Sub-centres (SCs), Primary Health Centres (PHCs), and Community HealthCentres (CHCs) in rural areas, along with the rise in doctors, nurses, and other medical personnelover time. With the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat programme, the strengthening ofSCs and PHCs are being done by converting them into Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs), ina phased manner, to deliver comprehensive Primary Healthcare services through these Centres.As on 31 December 2022, more than 1.5 lakh HWCs have already been set up.rural health care system in indiaCommunity Health Centre (CHC)30-bedded Hospital/Referral Unit for 4 PHCs with specialisedservicesPrimary Health Centre (PHC)Referral Unit for 6 Sub Centres 4-6 bedded manned with a MedicalOfficer-inchargeand subordinate paramedical staffSub Centre (SC)Most peripheral contact point between Primary Health Care System& Community manned with one Health worker (female)/AuxiliaryNurse Midwife & one Health Worker (male) Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 191table Vi.19: progress in health infrastructure(as of March each year)(numbers in thousands)indicators 2014 2019 2020 2021 2022Sub-centres (SCs) 152.3 157.4 155.4 156.1 157.9Primary Health Centres (PHCs) 25.0 24.9 24.9 25.1 24.9Community Health Centres (CHCs) 5.4 5.3 5.2 5.5 5.5Doctors at PHCs 27.4 29.8 28.5 31.7 30.6Total Specialists at CHCs 4.1 3.9 5.0 4.4 4.5Auxiliary Nurse Midwife at SCs & PHCs 213.4 234.2 212.6 214.8 207.6Nursing Staff at PHCs & CHCs 63.9 81.0 71.8 79.0 79.9Pharmacists at PHCs & CHCs 22.7 26.2 25.8 28.5 27.1Lab Technicians at PHCs & CHCs 16.7 18.7 19.9 22.7 22.8Source: Rural Health Statistics 2021-22, MoHWFNote: Greener shades indicate improvementsprogress under major government initiatives for Healthimmunisation6.88 Under Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP), immunisation is being provided freeof cost against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases: Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Measles,Rubella, a severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis, Rotavirus diarrhoea, Hepatitis B, etc. Toreinforce universal immunisation, Mission Indradhanush (MI) was launched in December 2014with the aim to rapidly increase full immunisation coverage of children to 90 per cent and sustainit thereafter.

The programme is held every year on 10 February and 10 August throughschools and Anganwadis, followed by mop-up days to cover those left out due to absenteeism orsickness. Besides Government and Government-aided schools and Anganwadis, special effortsare made to reach out-of-school children, and private schools have also enthusiastically joined theprogramme.During Covid-19, the continuity of deworming efforts were maintained while minimising risks.Frontline health workers were trained to follow appropriate safety guidelines during home visits orthrough staggered “Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Day” based model.Need for the ProgrammeSoil-Transmitted Helminthiases (STH), also known as parasitic intestinal worm infection, is apublic health concern adversely affecting children’s physical and cognitive growth.

The programme was expanded to includeall persons aged 12 years and above and for the precautionary dose for all persons aged 18 yearsand above. Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour continueto remain the tested strategy for Covid management.6.92 The introduction of Covid-19 vaccines entailed many challenges such as research anddevelopment for new Covid vaccines, training of more than 2.6 lakh vaccinators and 4.8lakh other vaccination team members, optimum utilisation of available vaccine, difficult-to-reach population, and the need to ensure all essential health services along with scaling upof vaccination programme. In addition, logistical challenges such as storage and decentraliseddistribution of vaccines across 29,000 cold chain points, augmenting cold chain capacity, anddeveloping IT platform for registering the beneficiaries and vaccine service delivery, were alsonoticed. The programme was able to overcome these challenges and meet its goals within ashort time frame.6.93 As on 6 January 2023, India has been able to administer more than 220 crore Covid vaccinedoses across the country. 97 per cent of eligible beneficiaries have already received at least onedose of Covid-19 vaccine and around 90 per cent of eligible beneficiaries have received both thedoses.

India had alertlyimplemented surveillance as early as 17 January 2020, even before the first few cases were officiallydetected. Covid-19 virus posed an unprecendented challenge to the country which was tackled withan agile approach, based on feed-back loops, real-time monitoring of actual outcomes, flexibleresponses, and safety-net buffers, as discussed in previous Economic Surveys.47 Over two years sincethe pandemic was declared, the Government has taken various fiscal and social measures to balancethe revival of the economy and deal with increasing caseloads. These included ramping up healthinfrastructure, both physical and digital, enhanced training of health professionals and, continuingwith the mass vaccination drive.Under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, the Union Government focussed on scaling up expenditureon health infrastructure by (a) investing in grass root health institutions and ramping up HWCs in ruraland urban areas; (b) setting up critical care hospital blocks in all districts; and (c) strengthening thelaboratory network and surveillance by integrated public health laboratories in all districts and blocksand public health units to manage pandemics. The State Governments also took various measuresto fight the pandemic. This was complemented by digital infrastructure through Co-WIN for massvaccination and e-Sanjeevani for telemedicine to reach the last mile. The timely intervention at alllevels helped India navigate the Covid pandemic successfully despite successive shocks.In the last few months, the caseload has subsided significantly, where the active caseload is below4000 and daily new cases recorded below 300 ( as of 29 December 2022).

After the successful rollout of two doses ofindigenous vaccines, the third dose was introduced.dedicated covid infrastructure:A three-tier arrangement of dedicated Covid-19 health facilities in the country had been implemented toreduce the risk of cross-infection to non-Covid patients and to make provision for non-Covid essentialhealth services. This three-tier arrangement of health facilities comprises (i) a Dedicated Covid CareCentre with isolation beds for mild or pre-symptomatic cases; (ii) a Dedicated Covid Health Centreoxygen-supported isolation beds for moderate cases, and (iii) Dedicated Covid Hospital with ICUbeds for severe cases. Besides this, tertiary care hospitals under the ESIC, Defence, Railways, CentralArmed Police Forces, Steel Ministry, etc., were also leveraged for case management. In addition, inmany states, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has utilised large-scalefield hospitals to rapidly scale up treatment capacities.oxygen infrastructure Strengthening during covid pandemicPressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Oxygen Generation Plants: PSA plants are being establishedin hospitals, especially in far-flung areas enabling the hospitals to become self-sufficient in thegeneration of oxygen for their needs and, thereby, reducing the burden on the medical oxygen supplygrid across the country. It was emphasised that each district of the country should have at least 1PSA plant from PM-CARES support at the public health facilities. Accordingly, 4,135 PSA plantsare being established in the country, which enhances the oxygen generation capacity by 4,852 MT,as per details below.

As per National Medical Commission (NMC), 13,08,009 allopathicdoctors are registered with the State Medical Councils and NMC as on June 2022. Assuming 80 percent availability of registered allopathic doctors and 5.7 lakh AYUSH doctors, the doctor-populationratio in the country is 1:834 against the WHO norms of 1:1000.initiatives for increasing/hiring/recruitment of doctors & StaffTo further augment the medical education facilities and improve the medical standards, theGovernment has envisaged various short and long-term measures, including: -(a) A CSS for establishing new medical colleges by upgrading district/ referral hospitals, underwhich 157 new medical colleges have been approved, out of which 94 are already functional.(b) A CSS for strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central GovernmentMedical Colleges to increase the number of MBBS and PG seats.(c) Under the “Upgradations of Government Medical Colleges by the construction of SuperSpecialty Blocks” of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) scheme, 75 projectshave been approved.(d) Under the Central Sector Scheme for setting up new AIIMS, 22 AIIMS have been approved.Undergraduate courses have started in 19 of these.(e) Relaxation in the norms for setting up of Medical College in terms of the requirement forfaculty, staff, bed strength, and other infrastructure.(f) Diplomate of National Board qualification has been recognised for appointment as teachingfaculty to take care of the faculty shortage.(g) Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges up to 70 years.To summarise, ‘Public Health’ being a State Subject, all the administrative and personnel matters,including appointment/recruitment/ engagement of doctors and staff in public health facilities, lie withthe respective State/UT Governments. No set of measures is sufficient to counter any instantaneousshock like the Covid pandemic, as the measures are designed with the assumption of ‘ceteris paribus’,meaning everything else remains the same. But the major difference is that we are operating in a newnormal, and hence towards the end, it is all about better management of the crisis and planning ahead.Thus, the strong inventory India has built over the last few years will improve the country’s overallhealth infrastructure and governance system. 198 Economic Survey 2022-23box Vi.10: co-Win: a successful digital story of vaccination to tellThe history of vaccines and vaccinations in India takes us back to 1802 when the first dose of vaccinewas registered for smallpox.48 Tracing the medical history of the vaccines during those times was arigorous task. However, in the contemporary scenario, we have substantially progressed in the digitaljourney, and most medical science searches are a ‘click’ away. Also, even before Covid arrived, Indiahad laid down the strategy for mass vaccination as year-long programs were running for several otherdiseases. Over the years, the government focused on digital health service delivery by imbibing thebasic philosophy of “Antyodaya”. However, the need for end-to-end digitisation in the vaccinationprocess was felt as this was the only way to achieve herd immunity during the pandemic. While manyeconomies had to develop a model from scratch, India was in a comfortable position. Thanks to theGovernment’s vision of the JAM trinity, the critical challenge was addressed in a time-bound mannerthrough Co-WIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network) in implementing the National Covid-19Vaccination Programme.Co-WIN has been developed as an extension of the eVIN (electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network)platform. A comprehensive cloud-based IT solution for planning, implementing, monitoring, andevaluating Covid-19 vaccination in India, the Co-WIN system provided an end-to-end solutionwith utilities for the entire public health system. The dual interface of the open platform made itscalable across citizen and administrator-centric services. To ensure accountability and transparencyin supply chains for vaccination, the platform provided real-time stock tracking at the national, state,and district levels (Government and Private). This further plugged the wastage of Covid-19 vaccines,which otherwise occurred pre-Co-WIN.Going beyond the users (admins, supervisors, and vaccinators), vaccination centres, and beneficiaries’registration in 12 regional languages, the web solution extended the issuance of digitally verifiablecertificates. The Vaccination Certificate was designed at par with WHO Guidelines to assist eveninternational travellers. To reduce the burden of registration hinging on a single document (Aadhaar),the Government allowed registration using any of the 10 photo identity cards [Aadhaar Card, DrivingLicense, PAN Card, Passport, Pension Passbook, NPR Smart Card, Voter ID, Unique DisabilityIdentification Card,Ration Card with Photo, Student Photo ID card]. Tackling the problem of thedigital divide and digital exclusion, multiple beneficiaries (up to six) were allowed onboarding usinga single mobile number through the National Covid helpline. To ensure that those having limitedaccess to physical facilities during times of Covid, either due to age, disability or identity, are not leftout, special provisions through the “Workplace Covid Vaccination Centre” in the Government andprivate sector and also “Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres “ were made available.The present administration of more than 220 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses was made possible becauseof the robust digital infrastructure of Co-WIN. It was this broad interlock of digital framework andthe Government’s vigour of continuously improving its outreach for better inclusion that India couldregister a quick and durable economic recovery while continuing to secure both lives and livelihoods.With more than 84.7 crore Co-WIN beneficiaries seeded with Aadhaar among the total 104 crore(between January 2021 to September 2022), the seeds of JAM sown in FY15 proved to be a life saverfor the nation.48 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4078488/ Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent 199Social protection for the rainy day6.94 While growth can lift people out of the low-income trap, it may not be able to ensure thatthey no longer remain vulnerable to any crisis situations in their lifetime. Thus, it is important toprotect citizens from risks posed by rainy days, such as health issues, natural disasters, old age,etc. Especially in the wake of the hardships posed by the pandemic, the government investedmore resources in social protection programmes and continued to do so in the FY23 with theunderstanding that strong social protection systems can support the growth process.

The states/ UTs have taken up thisexercise to verify/ update the JCs.(b) As a good governance initiative, the number of Registers (average 22 Registers in a GramPanchayat) being maintained at every Gram Panchayat has been brought down to sevenRegisters.(c) C ases of violation of Guidelines and Schedules are being followed up regularly. The InterstateStandard Operating Procedures (SoP) for visits were developed to improve the quality of thesocial audit process for all the states/UTs. This SoP will ensure all the Social Audit complianceas per Audit Standard Rule, 2011 which includes the establishment of an independent socialaudit unit, independent social audit director, and complete human resources to be trained asVillage Resource Persons (VRPs), timely calendar upload on MIS, timely conduct of theregular audit and uploading the issues on MIS within the stipulated timeline.(d) MGNREGA workers are being trained under recent initiatives like Bare Foot Technicians(BFT) to move them up the skilling ladder. So far, 8,394 BFTs have been trained in 20 States.(e) T he project “UNNATI” intends to upgrade the skill base of the MGNREGS workers, andthereby improve their livelihoods so that they can move from their current partial employmentto full employment. This project was launched in the FY20 and aims to enhance the skill baseof 2 lakh MGNREGA beneficiaries in three years i.e., FY20, FY21, and, FY22. So far, about27,383 candidates have been trained. UNNATI skilling project is meant to provide trainingto one adult member (of age 18-45 years) of a household who has completed 100 days ofwork under MGNREGA in the financial year from FY19. Full expenditures towards a stipend,against wage loss compensation, are entirely borne by the Central Government. A total of 2lakh beneficiaries are to be imparted training in 26 States and 2 UTs.(f) Around 5.5 crore households fall under the category of landless households dependent onmanual casual labour for livelihood as per the SECC 2011. The Government is making allefforts to get these households, not having JCs, to obtain employment under MGNREGA.Around 4.6 crore such households have been surveyed.(g) Area Officer Monitoring App was launched in May 2021, in a bid to facilitate the authoritiesto record their findings online. It will also help in recording time-stamped and geo-coordinatetagged photographs for all the schemes of the Department of Rural Development. It facilitatesanalysis of findings which in turn help in the implementation of the programme in a bettermanner.(h) National Mobile Monitoring Software (NMMS) App was launched in May 2021 which permitstaking real-time attendance of workers at MGNREGA worksites along with a geo-taggedphotograph. This app is a big step towards bringing transparency and proper monitoring of theschemes and will help in increasing citizen oversight of the programme.

This scheme willoffer deposit-free LPG connection, first refill and hot plate free of cost to beneficiaries, anda simplified enrolment procedure. In this phase, a special facility has been given to migrantfamilies. Under this Ujjwala 2.0 scheme, 1.6 crore connections have been released until 24November 2022.

The programme also has anupgradation component for those districts, where all the eligible habitations of the designatedpopulation size have been provided all-weather road connectivity. However, upgradation is justone of the components of the programme.6.122 The programme has been launched in three phases with the latest third phase havingbeen launched on 10 July 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 km through routes and majorrural links connecting habitations, inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets, higher secondaryschools, and hospitals. Since its inception, a total of 1,84,984 roads measuring 8,01,838 km and10,383 Long Span Bridges (LSBs) have been sanctioned under all the interventions/ verticalsof PMGSY. 1,73,775 number of roads measuring 7,23,893 km and 7,789 LSBs have beencompleted.6.123 The scheme has helped immensely in providing access to basic services and liftingthe income of rural masses. Various independent impact evaluation studies were carried out onPMGSY, which have concluded that the scheme has had a positive impact on agriculture, health,education, urbanization, employment generation, etc.electricitySAUBHAGYA- Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana6.124 The government launched the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana – Saubhagyain October 2017 with the objective to achieve universal household electrification by providingelectricity connections to all willing un-electrified households in rural areas and all willing poorhouseholds in urban areas in the country by March 2019. The Scheme involved the organisationof camps in villages/clusters villages for on-spot registration and the release of connections.The connections were given free for economically poor households and for others `500 wascharged after the release of the connection in 10 instalments. The Saubhagya scheme has beensuccessfully completed and closed on 31 March 2022.Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY)6.125 This scheme was launched in November 2014 with the objective to improve the qualityand reliability of power supply in rural areas. It envisaged the creation of basic electricityinfrastructure in villages/habitations, strengthening & augmentation of existing infrastructure,and metering of existing feeders/distribution transformers/consumers to improve the qualityand reliability of power supply in rural areas. Further, last-mile connectivity and free electricityconnections were also provided to BPL households only identified by the States as per their list.6.126 A total of 2.9 crore households have been electrified since the launch of the Saubhagyaperiod in October 2017 under various schemes viz (Saubhgaya, DDUGJY, etc.) 212 Economic Survey 2022-23direct benefit transfer: a game changer6.127 The Economic Survey 2014-15 showed that although price subsidies are widely usedas part of a standard toolkit by Governments in India in their anti-poverty programmes, theyare often regressive, distort the markets in ways that ultimately hurt the economically weak andthe leakages thereof seriously undermine the effectiveness of price as well as product subsidies.These distortions and leakages are such that they have an adverse impact on social welfare. Itwas recommended that the benefit that price subsidies seek to create for the poor can be directlytransferred to the poor through lump-sum income transfers, avoiding the distortions that pricesubsidies induce. Eliminating or phasing down subsidies is neither feasible nor desirable unlessaccompanied by other forms of support to cushion the poor and vulnerable and enable them toachieve their economic aspirations. The JAM Number Trinity – Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar andMobile numbers – has allowed the Government to offer this support to identified households ina targeted and less distortive way in the form of DBT.6.128 Since the inception of DBT, cumulative transfers of over `26.5 lakh crore in respect ofCentral schemes have been made through the DBT route. In this process, total savings of over`2.2 lakh crore have accrued as on 31 March 2021 for Central schemes alone due to the removalof 9.4 crore duplicate, fake/non-existent beneficiaries across databases.6.129 With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the imposition of lockdown andenforcement of social distancing norms, the DBT ecosystem faced a tough trial and emergedas a means of relief to millions of citizens whose livelihoods were impacted. DBT played amajor role in sustaining life, especially for the underprivileged segments of society, helpingmillions by providing immediate relief. Cash transfers under central schemes like PM-KISAN,MGNREGS, National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), Pradhan Mantri Matru VandanaYojana (PMMVY), NRLM, National Health Mission (NHM), scholarship schemes of variousministries through the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) and food subsidy under PradhanMantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana and Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package were a big relief for all theadversely affected masses of India during the Covid-19 period.6.130 To make DBT schemes more accessible and transparent, major DBT schemes are beingend-to-end digitized (EED) with provision for online and mobile-based access. 170 and 150Central Government DBT schemes are EED and available on Unified Mobile Application forNew Age Governance (UMANG) mobile platform respectively. Similarly, over 1000 States/ UTs DBT schemes are EED. For citizens who do not have access to smartphones, servicesavailable on UMANG are also available in assisted mode through Common Service Centres(CSCs) across India. The citizen experience in accessing DBT schemes through the UMANGapp is markedly rich since UMANG offers a well-catalogued bouquet of services in multipleIndian languages to cater to a wide audience.6.131 India’s successful implementation of DBT has won praise from the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank, among other international organizations, for efficientlyproviding support (subsidies, food grain, and cash benefits directly) to large masses at low-income levels (85 per cent of rural households and 69 per cent of urban households).

Some of the recent measures taken towards improving ruralgovernance are narrated below. 214 Economic Survey 2022-23rashtriya gram Swaraj abhiyan6.133 A CSS of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) was approved by the Union Cabinetin April 2018 for implementation from FY19 to FY22 with the primary aim of strengtheningPanchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for achieving SDG’s with the main thrust on convergencewith Mission Antyodaya and emphasis on strengthening PRI’s in the 117 Aspirational Districts.The scheme extends to all states and UTs including non-Part IX of the Constitution of Indiaareas where Panchayats do not exist.6.134 The major focus of the scheme of RGSA was Capacity Building and Training (CB&T) toempower PRIs and to prepare convergent Plans at the respective level of Panchayats. Under theScheme, not only around 31 lakh elected representatives (ERs) have been capacitated throughvarious modes of training but also functionaries and other stakeholders of Panchayats includingSHG members have been provided training for better SHG-PRIs convergence at the grassrootslevel to create an ecosystem to prepare inclusive village poverty reduction plan.6.135 The scheme has been revamped and approved in April 2022 for implementation overthe period FY23 to FY26. The focus of the scheme of Revamped RGSA is on re-imagining PRIsas vibrant centres of local self-governance with a special focus on the Localisation of SDGs(LSDGs) at the grassroots level adopting thematic approach through concerted and collaborativeefforts of Central Ministries and State line departments and other stakeholders with ‘Whole ofGovernment and Whole of Society’ approach. The Scheme has been formulated with the aim tostrengthen the capacities of institutions for rural local governance to become more responsivetowards local development needs, prepare participatory plans leveraging technology, andefficiently utilise available resources for realising sustainable solutions to local problems linkedto SDGs adopting the nine thematic approaches of LSDGs.59SVamitVa Scheme6.136 SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in VillageAreas) is a Central Sector Scheme launched on 24 April 2020, the National Panchayati Raj Day.The scheme aims to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners possessing housesin inhabited rural areas. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization ofproperties and enabling bank loans; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning, which would be the stepping-stone towards achieving Gram Swaraj in the truesense and making rural India Atmanirbhar. The scheme aims to provide the following benefits:• Creation of accurate land records for rural planning and reducing property-related disputes.• To bring financial stability to the citizens in rural India by enabling them to use their propertyas a financial asset for raising loans and other financial benefits.• Determination of property tax, which would accrue to the Gram Panchayats directly in stateswhere it is devolved or else, add to the state exchequer.• Creation of survey infrastructure and GIS maps that can be leveraged by any department fortheir use.59 Following are the themes for LSDGs: Poverty Free and Enhanced Livelihoods in Village; Healthy Village; Child-Friendly Village; WaterSufficient Village; Clean and Green Village; Village with Self-Sufficient Infrastructure; Socially Secured and Socially Just Village; Village withGood Governance and Women Friendly Village.

TheHon’ble Prime Minister observed in 2015:“The government must nurture an eco-system:– where the economy is primed for growth; and growth promotes all-round development;– where development is employment-generating; and employment is enabled by skills;– where skills are synced with production; and production is benchmarked to quality;– where quality meets global standards; and meeting global standards drives prosperityMost importanty, this prosperity is for the welfare of all” 606.139 Today, India is moving towards the attainment of the UN SDGs. While doing so, itis cognisant of the fact that for equitable development, a country as vast and diverse as Indiarequires the implementation of broad-based inclusive social policies, supported by adequateand commensurate financial resources. Thus, the character and contour of such an approachto development presents a unique set of challenges which is consistently being addressed inthe form of mindful reforms. Ensuring that intended outcomes of social sector developmentschemes reach the intended, involvement of the grassroot level of governance is imperativeand is being actively pursued. Technology has been a great enabler in ensuring the last-mileconnectivity of government schemes to the targeted citizens. It has revolutionised the deliveryof services while ensuring transparency and accountability. It needs to be harnessed further tohelp the government attain the lofty SDGs on the social front.6.140 As India marches ahead, the ground lost as regards social sector improvements dueto the pandemic, has largely been recouped, powered by prompt policymaking and efficientimplementation interwoven with technology. Going forward with the vision of ‘MinimumGovernment; Maximum Governance’, further developments will hold the key to attaining moreequitable economic growth. Evident ones include stepping up learning outcomes through digitaland teaching interventions in schools, enhancing the role of community workers in healthcare,pushing SHGs through better product design and upscaling enterprises. Further, channelisingwomen’s economic potential through ecosystem services such as affordable market alternativesfor care work, safe transportation and lodging, and long-term counselling support, can helpcapitalise the gender dividend for the country’s future economic and social development.******60 PM’s Inaugural address at Economic Times Global Business Summit, January 2015 https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?re-lid=114728 07Climate Change andenvironment: PreParingCHAPTERto FaCe the FutureClimate change is primarily attributed to disproportionately high cumulative emissions,both historical and high per capita annual emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) ofthe developed countries. The global nature of the problem makes India one of the mostvulnerable regions despite having contributed only about 4 per cent in the cumulativeglobal emissions (for the period 1850-2019) and maintaining its per capita emissionat far less than the world average. While India is less responsible for the high stockof emissions, however, it has consistently engaged in demonstrating global leadershiptowards adopting various measures and ensuring a low-emission growth pathway with acommitment to the net-zero emissions goal by 2070.India has integrated the development goals with ambitious climate action goals, be it inthe form of augmented solar power capacity (installed), higher energy saving targetingnotified in PAT cycle-VII, improved green cover facilitated by Green India Mission, amongother targeted Government actions. As part of dedicated efforts to preserve ecosystems,India now has 75 Ramsar sites for wetlands, in addition to various regulatory andpromotional measures to protect and conserve mangroves. Continued river conservationand rejuvenation efforts are underway through Namami Gange and National RiverConservation Plan (NRCP).In August 2022, the country updated the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)in line with the Hon’ble PM’s vision expressed in the 26th meeting of the Conferenceof Parties of UNFCCC. In terms of transition to renewable energy sources, India hasalready achieved its target of 40 per cent installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuelsahead of 2030. It has advanced the target to 50 per cent, which shall also translate to asignificant reduction in the average emission rate. The National Hydrogen Mission andGreen Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by2047. Its pivotal role is also reflected in India’s Long Term Low Emissions DevelopmentStrategy (LT-LEDS).The availability of adequate and affordable finance remains a constraint in India’s climateactions. The country has so far largely met its requirements from domestic sources only.Finance is a critical input for its climate actions. Therefore, the country has scaled up itsefforts towards mobilising private capital, including through sovereign green bonds, tomeet climate action goals. A framework for the latter has been issued in compliance withInternational Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (2021).India’s initiatives on the international stage have been noteworthy. The country hasactively engaged in global actions by championing the formation and strengthening ofvarious intergovernmental organisations. Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 217introduction7.1 Climate change is the long-term change in temperature and weather patterns that canoccur due to natural reasons, but since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the 19thcentury, it has been predominantly due to anthropogenic activities. GHG emissions remain inthe atmosphere for tens to hundreds of years, trapping the sun’s heat from escaping. Whilewithin limits, these make our earth more habitable, allowing for salubrious weather conditions,the enhanced emissions have led to rising temperatures with the potential to bring about sealevel rise, change monsoon cycles and impact land systems.7.2 GHG emissions are the most significant threat to humanity and the inescapable reality theworld faces. Action to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the changing climatic conditions arerequired urgently as the world has already started to experience its consequences. For instance,it is estimated that by 2030, about 700 million people worldwide will be at risk of displacementby drought alone (U.N. SDG Portal). Thus, global warming is a reality, and so is climate change.Nor is there much doubt that human activity is primarily responsible for it this time, althoughclimate change occurred in the distant past even when Planet Earth was scarcely populated.7.3 Despite agreement on the above, there can still be much divergence about what comes nextand what to do about it when it comes to climate change. Much of the global angst associatedwith climate change is about the emission of GHGs and carbon, in particular. The more GHGsare emitted, the more they stay trapped in the atmosphere, accelerating global warming. Hence,the argument goes that if some of the cataclysmic consequences are to be avoided, then globalwarming must be arrested, slowed and, if possible, reversed. One way to strive for it is to reduceemissions of GHG, including carbon. Many nations pledge to reduce their net emission to zeroby 2050. Some wish to achieve it by 2060 and by 2070.Figure vii.1: net Zero Pledges of countries (the Year pledged is on top of the bars)2070206520602060205520502045204020352030raeYorez-teNdegdelP2070205320502045Source: Emissions Gap Report 2022, UNEP 218 Economic Survey 2022-237.4 However, this is where things begin to get interesting. Science is not very clear onwhether further emission reduction would necessarily guarantee a stoppage or reversal of globalwarming. The reason being much carbon dioxide and other GHGs have already been emittedover the last two and half centuries of industrialisation-led economic growth in today’s advancednations, principally in North America and Europe. The share of developing countries in thestock of GHGs (usually measured as carbon dioxide equivalent) has been minimal compared todeveloped countries. This is corroborated by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), which highlights that the challenges faced due to global warming are mainly due tocumulative historical and current GHG emissions of developed countries. The impact of theaccumulation would also be iniquitous, with the developing countries not only bearing the bruntof climate change but also constrained by their capacity to respond to its challenges. The IPCC’sSixth Assessment Report (AR6) notes that high human vulnerability global hotspots are foundparticularly in West, Central & East Africa, South Asia, Central, and South America, SmallIsland Developing States, and the Arctic.7.5 Further, as per the report, Asia is most vulnerable to climate change, especially to extremeheat, flooding, sea level rise, and erratic rainfall. Ironically, the burden of adaptation is highestfor those who have contributed the least to global warming. That unfortunate inevitability meansthat the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere may have already set a train of events that futureemission reduction could do very little to stop or reverse.7.6 Even if the answer to this question is unclear or unknown, some correctly argue that notdoing whatever we can to make the planet more liveable and less dangerous may amount tocriminal negligence. The problem is that the people and nations making this argument have theirpriorities correct for themselves but not for the countries yet to climb the ladder of prosperity.It is an enduring principle of economics that resources have competing uses and that there arealways trade-offs.7.7 Today’s developing nations are therefore caught in the horns of a dilemma. How muchresources to devote to bread-and-butter developmental priorities and to adapting to the alreadychanging climate, and how much to dedicate to mitigating emissions of GHGs? Today’sdeveloped nations have prospered through the unrestricted use of fossil fuels, including coal,crude oil, and natural gas. It is theoretically elegant to argue that switching to renewable or non-fossil fuel energy would generate investments and jobs. Still, it seldom works out so smoothlyin practice.7.8 For example, China has declared that future energy supplies, including alternative ones,must be secured first before dispensing with existing energy sources. Countries might findthemselves not scrapping coal-fired power plants, and the alternatives may be held up eitherdue to a lack of technology, financial resources, skilled and trained human resources, or somecombination of all three. Countries have also learnt that the jobs that are likely to be created in theso-called ‘green economy’ are tilted towards skill and technology-intensive than in traditionalindustries.1 One may also argue that it may be easier to speak of retraining and relocating peoplethan actually doing so.1 World Economic Outlook, October 2021, Ch.1 World Economic Outlook, October 2021: Recovery During A Pandemic (imf.org) Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 2197.9 Nobel Laureate Thomas Schelling (2005) argued that the most effective way to combatclimate change was to let nations grow first2:“If per capita income growth in the next 40 years compares with the 40 years just past,vulnerability to climate change should diminish, and the resources available for adaptationshould be greater. I say this not to minimise concern about climate change but to anticipatewhether developing countries should make sacrifices in their development to minimise theemission of gases that may change the climate to their disadvantage. Their best defence againstclimate change may be their own continued development.”7.10 That economic growth would enable resource generation will come as no surprise tostudents of corporate finance. Companies generate profits and internal resources and thus fundtheir investments. For companies worldwide, the single biggest source of finance for their capitalinvestments is their own resources before they turn to markets. That would work for nations too.7.11 Another reason why it is a realistic proposition is that securing funding from eitherdeveloped nations or multilateral organisations is rather difficult. Public finances in developedcountries are stretched and do not seem to have the intent to mobilise adequate resources forclimate action in developing countries. They also do not have the appetite to provide additionalcapital to multilateral institutions for them to be able to lend more or mobilise greater resources.Further, the willingness and incentives-alignment of the private sector to undertake long-gestation projects are questionable at best or non-existent at worst.7.12 Lastly, it does not seem so strange or irresponsible that developing countries must puttheir own growth and development aspirations ahead of their global climate obligations whenone considers that developed countries set aside their obsessive concerns about climate changeand global warming to burn more coal to generate electricity this year. Aiming to reduce theirdependence on Russian crude oil and natural gas, countries in Europe had to switch to coal tokeep their homes warm and well-lit3. The behaviour of European nations in 2022, eminentlyunderstandable, demonstrates the return of energy security as a prime requirement for countries.Therefore, it stands to reason that it would be no different for developing economies too.7.13 Earlier in the year, the OECD and the Social Economics Lab at Harvard teamed upto understand why policies to address climate change have been difficult to implement andsurveyed over 40,000 respondents across 20 of the world’s most carbon-emitting countries(representing 72 per cent of global CO emissions). The findings were striking4. In general,2citizens in developed countries expressed considerable reluctance to change their lifestyles andhabits with respect to driving, flying and eating that would contribute to reduced emissions.Policies to implement carbon pricing have not been easy in all European countries. France triedand retreated in 2018. Switzerland’s proposal was defeated in a referendum in 2021.2 Thomas C. Schelling (1992): ‘Some economics of global warming’, American Economic Review, March 1992 Some Economics of GlobalWarming on JSTOR3 ‘Germany Revives Coal as Energy Security Trumps Climate Goals’, Bloomberg, 22 December 2022 (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-22/germany-returns-to-coal-as-energy-security-trumps-climate-goals)4 ‘Fighting Climate Change: International Attitudes Toward Climate Policies’, NBER Working Paper No. 30265, September 2022 (https://www.nber.org/papers/w30265) 220 Economic Survey 2022-237.14 As though these challenges are not enough, many experts also warn of the availability ofrare earth elements (REE) and critical minerals (CM) to be the next geopolitical battlegroundas crude oil has been over the last fifty years.5 As we are aware, REE and CM are essential forgenerating renewable energy. The problem is that they are produced in a few countries andprocessed in even fewer countries. A globally synchronised energy transition to non-fossil fuelsmight be difficult to pull off if adequate REE and CM are not available. That would leave thefossil fuel-based assets stranded for many countries’ economies!7.15 Jean Pisani-Ferry, associated with the Bruegel Institute and an advisor to the FrenchGovernment, has begun to sound the alarm about climate change’s significant short-runmacroeconomic costs. Citing him in his article for the International Monetary Fund’s ‘Financeand Development’, Daniel Yergin writes6,“The economist Jean Pisani-Ferry, cofounder of Bruegel, Europe’s leading economic think tank,has observed that accelerating the targets for net carbon emission reductions too aggressivelycould create much larger economic disruptions than generally anticipated—what he called“an adverse supply shock—very much like the shocks of the 1970s.” Such a transition, Pisani-Ferry presciently wrote in 2021, just before the current energy crisis began, is “unlikely to bebenign and policymakers should get ready for tough choices.” He subsequently added, in 2022:“Climate action has become a major macroeconomic issue, but the macroeconomics of climateaction is far from the level of rigour and precision that is now necessary to provide a soundbasis for public discussions and to guide policymakers adequately. For understandable reasons,advocacy has too often taken precedence over analysis. But at this stage of the discussion,complacent scenarios have become counterproductive. The policy conversation now needsmethodical, peer-examined assessments of the potential costs and benefits of alternative plansfor action.”7.16 However, whether we like it or not, the climate change issue will be increasingly relevantand will occupy the airwaves and the attention of policymakers. Countries, even if they waitfor financial, technological and human resources for emissions mitigation, have to take actionto make their people resilient and adapt to climate change. So, actions on multiple fronts areneeded, including the estimation of resources, lifestyle adjustments etc.7.17 Here, India, considered to be one of the most vulnerable countries given its long coastline,monsoon-dependent agriculture, and large agrarian economy, is one of the leading examples ofthis. It has contributed only 4 per cent (until 2019) to the cumulative global emissions and its percapita emission is far less than the world average.7.18 The fact that climate change is a global phenomenon and requires collective efforts hasbeen widely accepted and is the basis of the commitments in the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement. Recognising thedifferentiated responsibility of countries (in view of their role in GHG emissions) and the higherdevelopmental needs of the developing countries, they call for a collective action based on the5 ‘The new-style energy crisis’, Daniel Yergin interviewed by Project Syndicate, July 2022 (https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/new-style-energy-crisis-by-daniel-yergin-2022-07)6 Daniel Yergin (2022): ‘Bumps in the Energy Transition’, Finance & Development, International Monetary Fund, December 2022 (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/12/bumps-in-the-energy-transition-yergin) Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 221principles of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities(CBDR-RC). The collective action has translated into NDCs-through which each country hasmade a commitment to work towards a collective goal of keeping temperature rise to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.7.19 India has been striving to pursue the goal of sustainable development. It spearheads oneof the most robust climate actions through its NDCs, which includes an ambitious programmefor transitions to clean energy in the world. Despite the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on theeconomy, the country has enhanced its climate ambition manifold and embarked on a long-termstrategy towards a low GHG emission based development.7.20 Having set the context, this chapter presents an updated discussion on the issue of climatechange from India’s perspective, including a discussion on forests and their role in mitigatingcarbon emissions, an approach to transition to renewable energy and the recently submitted lowemissions development strategy. The chapter further presents a discussion on the outcomes ofthe 27th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 27), progress made on enabling financing forsustainable development and India’s role in global efforts towards addressing climate change.Besides this, recent changes in environmental regulations and other environmental aspects, suchas biodiversity and wildlife, are also discussed.Progress on india’s Climate action7.21 India’s climate vision is integrally linked to its vision of development that foregroundsthe goals of poverty eradication and guaranteeing basic well-being to all its citizens. Action onaddressing climate action was initiated even before the Paris Agreement came into being. In2008, India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), establishing eightNational Missions, covering several initiatives and a slew of measures in the area of solar, water,energy efficiency, forests, sustainable habitat, sustainable agriculture, sustaining Himalayanecosystem, capacity building and research and development (R&D).Figure vii.2: Progress on eight national missions of the naPCC highlighting achievementsacross various domains•Solar power capacity of 61.62 GW installed byNational Solar MissionOctober 2022•PAT Cycle–VII notified in October 2021 for energyNational Mission for Enhancedsaving target of 6.63 Million Tonnes of Oil EquivalentEnergy Efficiency(MTOE)•721 km of metro rail network made operational byAugust 2022.National Mission on•62.79 lakh individual household toilets and 6.21 lakhSustainable Habitatcommunity and public toilets constructed by April2022National Mission for a Green •₹ 626.96 crore for afforestation targets over an area ofIndia 2.1 lakh haNational Water Mission •Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain 2022National Mission on Strategic •Created and strengthened 12 Centres of Excellence forKnowledge for Climate Change climate change (June 2021)National Mission for Sustaining •Inter-University ConsortiumHimalayan Ecosystems •8 Major R&D Programmes initiated•Key targets for FY 2022-2023 covering 0.15 lakhNational Mission forha under organic farming and 10 lakh ha under microSustainable Agricultureirrigation 222 Economic Survey 2022-237.22 National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), a central sector scheme, wasinitiated in 2015-16 to support adaptation activities in the States and Union Territories (UTs)of India that are vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. NAFCC is implementedin project mode, and to date, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States and UTs with atotal project cost of ₹847.5 crore. NAFCC supports adaptation action, in, inter alia, agriculture,water, forestry, livestock, and restoring ecosystems. At present (November 2022), 28 projectsare under implementation.7.23 Demonstrating higher ambition in its climate action, the Government of India submittedits updated NDC on August 26, 2022. The new NDC with enhanced targets translates the visionof the Hon’ble PM expressed through the “Panchamrit” at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties(COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021. The vision mentions of sustainable lifestyles andclimate justice to protect the poor and vulnerable from the adverse impacts of climate change.Aligning with this vision, the share of non-fossil fuel-based capacity in overall capacity has risenrapidly over time. Including the large hydro, the share of non-fossil sources in total installedelectricity capacity is estimated to be about 40.4 per cent (on 31.09.2022) compared to 27.3 percent in 2014-15. This period has seen a sizeable enhancement in the share of installed electricitycapacity in solar and wind energy from 8.9 per cent in 2014-15 to 25.1 per cent in 2022-23(April-Sept).Box vii.1: india’s updated nationally determined Contribution (ndC)India submitted its first NDC to UNFCCC in October 2015. This was updated in August 2022. The2015 NDC comprised eight goals, three of which were quantitative targets to be achieved up to 2030.The three targets included cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources toreach 40 per cent, reduction in the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35 per cent compared to 2005levels, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO equivalent through2additional forest and tree cover.Article 4 of the Paris Agreement provides that each Party shall communicate or update its NDCevery five years. Therefore, in accordance with the aforesaid provision of the Paris Agreement, Indiasubmitted the following updates to its first NDC of 2015.1. To put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditionsand values of conservation and moderation, including through a mass movement for ‘LIFE’–‘Lifestyle for Environment’ as a key to combating climate change.2. To adopt a climate-friendly and cleaner path than the one followed hitherto by others at thecorresponding level of economic development.3. To reduce the Emissions Intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, from the 2005 level.4. To achieve about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossilfuel-based energy resources by 2030, with the help of the transfer of technology and low-costinternational finance, including from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 2235. To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO equivalent through2additional forest and tree cover by 2030.6. To better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes insectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, the Himalayanregion, coastal regions, and health and disaster management.7. To mobilise domestic and new & additional funds from developed countries to implement theabove mitigation and adaptation actions in view of the resource required and the resource gap.8. To build capacities and create a domestic framework and international architecture for quickdiffusion of cutting-edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative R&D for suchfuture technologies.Source: Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate ChangeStatus of Forest and tree Cover7.24 One of the three quantifiable targets of India’s NDC is to achieve an additional carbon sinkof 2.5 billion to 3.0 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The forestand tree cover in India has shown a gradual and steady trend of increase in the last one and a halfdecades.7.25 The country ranks third globally with respect to the net gain in average annual forest areabetween 2010 and 2020. This gain is mainly attributed to the robust framework and policies ofthe National and State Governments that have promoted and safeguarded forests. Schemes likethe Green India Mission (GIM), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and PlanningAuthority (CAMPA), National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green Highway Policy - 2015,Policy for enhancement of Urban Greens, National Agro-forestry Policy, and Sub-Mission onAgro-forestry (SMAF), etc. are among the most important ones.Carbon Stock in india’s Forest and tree Cover7.26 A robust forest ecosystem is a vital sink of carbon. Forest Survey of India (FSI) assessedthe carbon stock (which is the amount of carbon sequestrated from the atmosphere and storedin biomass, deadwood, soil, and litter in the forest) in India’s forests for the first time in 2004and then biennially since 2011. The Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR) estimates the carbonstock of forests to be about 7,204 million tonnes in 20197, which is an increase of 79.4 milliontonnes of carbon stock as compared to the estimates of the previous assessment for 2017. Thistranslates into carbon emissions sequestrated through forest and tree cover to be 30.1 billiontonnes of CO equivalent.27 ISFR-2021. https://fsi.nic.in/forest-report-2021-details 224 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure vii.3: Carbon stock in forests in india has been rising7250720472007150 71257100 70827044705070006941695069002011 2013 2015 2017 2019(ISFR-2013) (ISFR-2015) (ISFR-2017) (ISFR-2019) (ISFR-2021))sennotnoillim(kcotsnobraCSource: Based on data of the Forest Survey of India7.27 Among the Indian States, Arunachal Pradesh has the maximum carbon stock in forests(1023.84 million tonnes), followed by Madhya Pradesh (609.25 million tonnes). The per-hectareforest carbon stock among different States/UTs indicates that Jammu & Kashmir is contributingthe maximum per-hectare carbon stock of 173.41 tonnes, followed by Himachal Pradesh (167.0tonnes), Sikkim (166.2 tonnes) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (162.9 tonnes).Preservation of ecosystems: a Critical adaptation action7.28 Ecosystems play an important role in carbon storage, protect the coastal areas, andenhance water quality besides other services, such as cultural, spiritual or tourist attractions.Wetlands are natural buffers against floods, droughts, and tropical cyclones. Wetlands can act assponges, storing peak rainfall and releasing water gradually during the lean season. The floodsin Kashmir Valley in September 2014 and Chennai city in December 2015 are reminders ofthe ways wetland destruction can make lives vulnerable. The Ramsar Convention, signed onFebruary 2, 1971, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accords signed by member countriesto preserve the ecological character of their wetlands of international importance. Wetlandsdeclared as Ramsar sites are protected. India has 75 Ramsar sites covering an area of 13.3 lakhha, and 49 of these have been added in the last 8 years.7.29 Mangroves and coastal wetlands form the first line of defence for coastal communitiesagainst increased storm surges, flooding, and hurricanes. As per a recent study, certain mangrovespecies in Chilika and Sundarbans along the east coast and Dwarka and Porbandar along thewest coast of India are likely to reduce and shift landward by 2070 due to a decline in suitablehabitats in response to precipitation and sea level changes.87.30 The Government has taken both regulatory and promotional measures to protect andconserve mangroves. The National Coastal Mission Programme on ‘Conservation andManagement of Mangroves and Coral Reefs’ is being implemented. Regulatory measures areimplemented through Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification (2019) under the Environment8 Pujarini Samal, Jyoti Srivastava, S.R.

Works proposed under these DPRs include afforestation on riverbanksleading to increased green cover, measures to contain soil erosion, recharge the groundwatertable, sequester carbon dioxide, catchment area treatment, ecological restoration, moistureconservation, livelihood improvement & income generation, etc.approach to transition to renewable energy Sources7.33 While the target was to achieve 40 per cent of the installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 in the initial NDC submitted in 2015, the target has already beenachieved. India is now striving to achieve the target of 50 per cent cumulative electric powerinstalled capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, in line with updatedNDCs. 226 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure vii.5: increasing installed electricity generation Capacity with a rising share of non-fossil fuel-based capacity450 45400 40350 35300 30250 25200 20150 15100 1050 50 02014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22)WG(yticapaCdellatsnItnecrePThermal NuclearRenewable energy sources Large hydroPer cent of non-fossil fuel based capacity (RHS)Source: Based on data from the Ministry of Power.7.34 India is progressively becoming a favoured destination for investment in renewables.

It will be crucial forachieving decarbonisation of harder-to-abate sectors such as fertilisers, refining, methanol, 228 Economic Survey 2022-23maritime shipping, iron & steel and long-haul transport. Green hydrogen is also an importantelement of India’s Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS).7.38 With a vision to make India an energy-independent nation, and to de-carbonise criticalsectors, the Government approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission on January 4, 2023with an initial outlay of ₹19,744 crore. The Mission will facilitate demand creation, production,utilisation and export of Green Hydrogen and mobilisation of over ₹8 lakh crore of investmentby 2030.Figure vii.9: Salient Features of the national green hydrogen mission• Green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5MMT (Million Metric Tonne) per annum.• Cumulative reduction in fossil fuel imports over ₹1Likely Outcomes by 2030 lakh crore and creation of over 6 lakh jobs.• Renewable energy capacity addition of about 125GW and abatement of nearly 50 MMT of annual GHGemissions.• Financial incentive targeting domestic manufacturingof electrolysers and production of Green Hydrogen.Interventions • Regions capable of supporting large scale productionand/or utilisation of Hydrogen to be developed asGreen Hydrogen Hubs.•Development of an enabling policy framework tosupport establishment of Green Hydrogen ecosystem.Policy Framework • Robust Standards and Regulations framework.• Public-private partnership framework for R&D.• Skill development programmeSource: Ministry of New & Renewable Energy7.39 A report by NITI Aayog9 in June 2022 shows that in the case of India, renewable tariffs havefallen in recent years, and electrolyser costs are expected to fall in the future. A recent report by theInternational Renewable Energy Agency (2020)10 suggests that the cost of electrolysers is crucialfor making green hydrogen economically viable. The report also underscores the importance ofinnovation in electrolyser technology and the rapid increase in its scale of production as themain factors that would drive down the cost of electrolysers and green hydrogen.7.40 NITI’s report estimates that the cumulative value of the green hydrogen market in Indiawill be US$ 8 billion by 2030 and US$ 340 billion by 2050. The electrolyser market will beapproximately US$ 5 billion by 2030 and US$ 31 billion by 2050. In addition, the adoption ofgreen hydrogen will also result in 3.6 Giga tonnes of cumulative CO emission reduction by22050. This will also generate enormous energy import savings, ensure stability in industry inputprices, and strengthen foreign exchange reserves in the long run.9 ‘Harnessing Green Hydrogen – Opportunities for Deep Decarbonisation in India’, published in June 2022 by NITI Aayog. https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/202206/Harnessing_Green_Hydrogen_V21_DIGITAL_29062022.pdf10 International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (2020) Green hydrogen cost reduction: Scaling up electrolysers to meet the 1.50C Cli-mate Goal.

This is because an energy system powered by clean energy technologies differs profoundlyfrom one fuelled by traditional hydrocarbon resources. Cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, and rare earthelements (REEs) are critical for producing electric vehicles and batteries and harnessing solar powerand wind energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants, wind farms and electric vehicles (EVs) generallyrequire more minerals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts. A typical electric car requires six timesthe mineral inputs of a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more mineralresources than a gas-fired plant12.The types of mineral resources used vary by technology. Lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphiteare crucial to battery performance, longevity and energy density. REEs are essential for permanentmagnets that are vital for wind turbines and EV motors. Electricity networks need a huge amount ofcopper and aluminium, with copper being a cornerstone for all electricity-related technologies.While the demand for critical minerals is set to increase because of the global preference and emphasistowards renewable energy, the global supply chain of the critical minerals is highly concentrated andunevenly distributed. The skewed distribution of the resource poses a supply risk in the face of itsenhanced demand.11 LCOH refers to the cost of hydrogen production per unit of hydrogen includind capital and operational costs.12 International Energy Agency Report on ‘The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions’. The Role of Critical Minerals in CleanEnergy Transitions – Analysis - IEA 230 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure vii.11: Concentration of production of selected minerals in 2019 and 2025Source: International Energy Agency Report on ‘The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions’A carefully crafted multi-dimensional mineral policy would reduce our dependence and address theproblems for the future. The country has resources of nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and heavy REEs,but further exploration would be needed to evaluate the quantities of their reserves. There is a need tocreate strategic mineral reserves along the lines of strategic petroleum reserves to ensure a continuoussupply of minerals. Also, policies should consider investing in internal research including technologicalinnovation for mineral exploration and processing and the development of Recycling, Reusing, andRepurposing (R3) technologies.In order to ensure the mineral security of the nation and to attain self-reliance in the area of critical andstrategic minerals, the Ministry of Mines has created a Joint Venture company, namely Khanij BideshIndia Ltd (KABIL), with participating interests of NALCO, HCL and MECL. KABIL is mandated toidentify and acquire overseas mineral assets of critical and strategic nature, such as Lithium, Cobalt etc.Further, the Ministry of Mines, Government of India and the Department of Industry, Science, Energyand Resources (DISER), Government of Australia, signed an MoU on June 3, 2020 for cooperation inthe field of mining and processing of critical and strategic minerals. Further, KABIL has also signeda detailed MoU with a collaborative framework with the Critical Minerals Facilitation Office underthe DISER on March 10, 2022 to identify lithium and cobalt mineral assets for final joint investmentdecisions and acquisition of the assets in Australia catering to the critical and strategic ecosystem ofboth the countries.long-term low emissions development Strategy (lt-ledS)7.42 India submitted its Long-Term Low Carbon Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) onNovember 14, 2022, at COP 27. The salient features of LT-LEDS are:• Focus on the rational utilisation of national resources with due regard to energy security.The transitions from fossil fuels will be undertaken in a just, smooth, sustainable and all-inclusive manner.• Encompasses the objectives of the National Hydrogen Policy. The rapid expansion of greenhydrogen production, increasing electrolyser manufacturing capacity in the country, and a Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 231three-fold increase in nuclear capacity by 2032 are some of the other milestones that areenvisaged alongside the overall development of the power sector.• Increased use of biofuels, especially ethanol blending in petrol. The drive to increase electricvehicle penetration, and the increased use of green hydrogen fuel are expected to drive thelow carbon development of the transport sector. India aspires to maximise the use of electricvehicles, ethanol blending to reach 20 per cent by the Ethanol Supply Year 2025-26, and astrong modal shift to public transport for passengers and freight.• Climate-resilient urban development will be driven by smart city initiatives, integratedplanning of cities for mainstreaming adaptation and enhancing energy and resourceefficiency, effective green building codes and developments in innovative solid and liquidwaste management.• India’s industrial sector will continue on a strong growth path, with the vision of ‘AatmanirbharBharat’ and ‘Make in India’.7.43 LT-LEDS has been prepared in the framework of India’s right to an equitable and fairshare of the global carbon budget and is the practical implementation of India’s call for “climatejustice.” This is essential to ensure that there are no constraints on realising India’s vision ofrapid growth and economic transformation while protecting the environment. The LT-LEDS isdriven by the vision of LiFE, Lifestyle for the Environment that calls for a worldwide paradigmshift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation. Here, thetransition to low carbon development pathway will entail costs. In addition, the provision forclimate finance by developed countries will play a very significant role and, therefore, needs tobe considerably enhanced in the form of grants and concessional loans.Finance for Sustainable development7.44 Finance is a critical input in India’s climate actions. The country’s climate actions haveso far been largely financed from domestic sources, including government budgetary support, amix of market mechanisms, fiscal instruments, and policy interventions. India has shown globalleadership in the fight against climate change and has committed itself to achieving net-zeroemissions by 2070. While several estimates of the required investments are indicated in the LT-LEDS report prepared by India, it is important to note that all allude to a need for tens of trillionsof US dollars.7.45 The understanding in the Convention and the Paris Agreement has been that the developedcountries will mobilise the resources through public and other sources, including by catalysingprivate finance to enable a flow of financial resources at a reasonable cost. While these are yetto materialise, India has scaled up its efforts towards greater mobilisation of private capital tomeet its ambitious climate action goals.green Bonds7.46 Green bonds are financial instruments that generate proceeds for investment inenvironmentally sustainable and climate-suitable projects. With the growing focus on theenvironmental sustainability of projects, green bonds have become widely accepted as an 232 Economic Survey 2022-23instrument to raise funds to support climate and environmental projects and command a relativelylower cost of capital vis-à-vis regular bonds. Major countries that resorted to green bonds toraise funds include the UK, France, Germany, the USA, and China. IMF data indicates thatgreen bonds of value around US$ 620 billion were issued across the world in the year 2021, inwhich countries issued green bonds of value US$ 587.7 billion and international organisationsissued bonds of value US$ 32.3 billion. As per SEBI’s data on green debt securities, duringthe period of 2017 to September 2022, 15 Indian corporates have issued green bonds of value₹4,539 crore. Most of these are related to renewable energy generation, while one is slated tobe used for the tertiary treatment of wastewater.Figure vii.12: Status of Sovereign green Bond issuances in 202125 21.720 16.1 15.314.2158.810 5.75 2.30.8 0.5 0.40United France Italy Germany China, Spain Serbia, Korea, Hungary ColombiaKingdom P.R.: Rep. of Rep. ofHongKongnoillib$SUSource: IMF Climate Change Dashboard7.47 In keeping with the ambition to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy significantly,the Union Budget 2022-23 announced the issue of Sovereign Green Bonds. The issuance ofSovereign Green Bonds will help the government to tap the requisite finance from potentialinvestors for deployment in public sector projects aimed at reducing the carbon intensity ofthe economy. The final Sovereign Green Bonds framework of India has been issued. TheFramework has been designed to comply with the components and key recommendations of theInternational Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (2021).7.48 A Green Finance working committee has also been set up to oversee and validate keydecisions on the issuance of Sovereign green bonds. The committee has the mandate to selectthe projects for allocation of proceeds, do a time-bound review of the allocation and carry outannual reporting along with an impact assessment of the proceeds from sovereign green bondsissued.7.49 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has notified the indicative calendar for the issuance ofSovereign Green Bonds (SGrBs) for the fiscal year 2022-23. The issuance would take placethrough two auctions on January 25, 2023 and February 9, 2023, respectively, for ₹8,000 croreeach, totalling ₹16,000 crore. The security-wise allocation would include 5 year and 10 yearSGrBs for ₹4,000 crore each for both auctions. Five per cent of the notified amount of sale hasbeen reserved for retail investors as specified under the ‘Scheme for Non-competitive BiddingFacility in the auction of Government of India Dated Securities and Treasury Bills’. The SGrBswill be designated as specified securities under the ‘Fully Accessible Route’ for investmentin Government Securities by non-residents. Over time, the SGrBs would provide a pricing Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 233reference for private sector entities in India for their domestic borrowings through Environment,Social, and Governance (ESG) bonds. Thus, the issuance of SGrBs would help in creating anecosystem which fosters a greater flow of capital into green projects and entities undertakingsuch projects.regulatory Framework for issuance of green debt Securities7.50 On November 3, 2021, the RBI published its ‘Statement of Commitment to SupportGreening India’s Financial System’ - NGFS. Here, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) laid out,keeping in view its national commitments, priorities, and complexity of our financial system,committed to, among others, exploring how climate scenario exercises can be used to identifyvulnerabilities in RBI-supervised entities’ balance sheets, business models and gaps in theircapabilities for measuring and managing climate-related financial risks. Also, in 2007, the RBIadvised banks to put in place an appropriate action plan for making a meaningful contributionto sustainable development. Over time, RBI has incentivised bank lending towards greenerindustries and projects. For example, renewable energy projects have been included underPriority Sector Lending (PSL). The RBI has also been spreading awareness on the issue of greenand sustainable finance by discussing the opportunities and challenges of green finance throughits publications and other communication.7.51 SEBI introduced the regulatory framework for issuance of green debt securities as amode of sustainable finance under the erstwhile SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities)Regulations, 2008, (ILDS Regulations), vide circular dated May 30, 2017.7.52 At the time of review of the ILDS Regulations, the provisions of the erstwhile circularwere subsumed, and the definition of “green debt security” was incorporated as Regulation2(1)(q) in the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Securities) Regulations, 2021 (‘NCSRegulations’). The disclosure requirements were prescribed vide Operational Circular datedAugust 10, 2021.7.53 Recently, vide a circular dated November 24, 2022, SEBI has allowed an issuer under theSEBI (Issue and Listing of Municipal Debt Securities) Regulations, 2015 (‘ILMDS Regulations’)to issue a green debt security if it falls within the definition of “green debt security” as perRegulation 2(1)(q) of the NCS Regulations. Such an issuer has to comply with both ILMDSRegulation and NCS Regulations.7.54 In the backdrop of increasing interest in sustainable finance in India as well as aroundthe globe, and with a view to aligning the extant framework for green debt securities withthe updated Green Bond Principles recognised by International Organisation of SecuritiesCommission (IOSCO), SEBI undertook a review of the regulatory framework for green debtsecurities. Based on the review, it has been decided in the SEBI board meeting dated December20, 2022, to:a. Enhance the scope of the definition of green debt security by including new modes ofsustainable finance in relation to pollution prevention and control, eco-efficient products,etc.; 234 Economic Survey 2022-23b. Introduce the concept of blue bonds (related to water management and marine sector),yellow bonds (related to solar energy) and transition bonds as subcategories of green debtsecurities.investing in resilience for Sustainable development7.55 SEBI has been one of the early adopters of sustainability reporting for listed entitiesand requires mandatory ESG-related disclosures for the top 100 listed entities (by marketcapitalisation) since 2012. Over the years, the requirement was strengthened to cover the top500 and then the top 1000 entities. SEBI has issued new sustainability reporting requirementsunder the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), which are more granularwith quantifiable metrics in line with the principles ensconced in the ‘National Guidelines onResponsible Business Conduct’. The BRSR was made mandatory for the top 1000 listed entities(by market capitalisation) from 2022–23.

In conjunction with COP 27, the 17th Session of the Conference of Parties serving as themeeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP17), the 4th Session of the Conference ofthe Parties serving as the Meeting of Parties to Paris Agreement (CMA4), 57th session of theSubsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body forImplementation (SBI) were also held.7.57 India participated in COP 27, with a focus on mainstreaming the theme of LiFE - Lifestylefor Environment. The Indian Pavilion at COP 27 highlighted the theme of LiFE in various ways– models, audio-visual displays, activities, and 49 side events. India invited all countries to jointhe LiFE movement, which is a pro-people and pro-planet effort seeking to shift the world frommindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation of natural resources.7.58 The cover decision of COP 27, titled the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, notes the‘importance of the transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumptionand production for efforts to address climate change’. Other decisions were setting up the JustTransition and Mitigation Work Program and the agreement on Joint work on the implementationof climate action on agriculture and food security to be conducted over four years.7.59 During COP 27, developing nations strongly voiced setting up a separate fund for loss anddamage. After negotiations, it was decided to establish new funding arrangements for assistingdeveloping countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate changein responding to loss and damage, with a focus on addressing loss and damage. A transitionalcommittee has been established to work out the modalities.13 Beloskar, V. D., & Rao, S. V. D. (2022). Did ESG Save the Day? Evidence from India During the Covid-19 Crisis.

The COP 21 decided that, prior to 2025, a New Collective Quantified Goal(NCQG) on climate finance from a floor of US$ 100 billion per year, taking into account theneeds and priorities of developing countries, shall be set. To further the agenda of setting theNCQG by 2024, COP 27 decided that Four Technical Expert Dialogues (TEDs) will be carriedout prior to COP 28.india’s initiatives at the international Stageinternational Solar alliance (iSa)7.62 The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is a treaty-based inter-governmental organisationworking to create a global market system to tap the benefits of solar power and promote cleanenergy applications. ISA’s mission is to unlock US$ 1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030while reducing the cost of the technology and its financing. With the signing and ratificationof the ISA Framework Agreement by 15 countries on 6 December 2017, ISA became the firstinternational intergovernmental organisation to be headquartered in India. ISA is partneringwith multilateral development banks (MDBs), development financial institutions (DFIs), privateand public sector organisations, civil society, and other international institutions to deploy cost-effective and transformational solutions through solar energy, especially in the least DevelopedCountries (LDCs) and the Small Island Developing States (SIDS).7.63 The ISA has expanded its coverage to all its 110 member countries. It assists them with theadoption of solar energy with the view to improving energy access, ensuring energy security andfacilitating the energy transition. Through the programmatic support offered by ISA, a pipelineof 9.5 GW of solar energy capacity has been identified in its member countries, including large-scale solar parks in multiple developing countries. In its member countries, with a grant ofUS$ 50,000, ISA is assisting in setting up solar energy demonstration projects. Three suchdemonstration projects were inaugurated at the Fifth Assembly of ISA.Coalition for disaster resilient infrastructure7.64 The CDRI was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India during the United NationsClimate Action Summit on 23 September 2019 in New York. It is a global partnership of NationalGovernments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financingmechanisms, the private sector, and academic and knowledge institutions. It aims to promote theresilience of infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks, thereby ensuring sustainabledevelopment. 236 Economic Survey 2022-237.65 As on 29 June 2022, thirty-one Countries, six International Organisations and twoprivate sector organisations have joined as members of CDRI. CDRI has been expanding itsmembership consistently by attracting a wide variety of economically advanced countries,developing countries, and countries that are most vulnerable to climate change and disasters.Over a period, a network of organisations/stakeholders will be developed to advance disaster-resilient infrastructure not only in India but in other partner countries as well.leadership group for industry transition (leadit)7.66 The LeadIT gathers countries and companies that are committed to action to achieve theParis Agreement. It was launched by the governments of Sweden and India at the UN ClimateAction Summit in September 2019 and is supported by the World Economic Forum. LeadITmembers subscribe to the notion that energy-intensive industries can and must progress on low-carbon pathways, aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.7.67 During COP 27, LeadIT members adopted a joint statement wherein members collectivelyagreed to:(i) promote value chain partnerships and material circularity;(ii) invest and cooperate on the planning and implementation of infrastructure to supportenergy and industry transitions;(iii) give multilateral development banks and multilateral climate funds mandates to de-riskinvestments in the transition of heavy industries in emerging and developing countries;(iv) formulate roadmaps for heavy industry sectors that include regulatory frameworks,incentives, and long-term strategies, to facilitate transition finance and attract privateinvestments.initiatives related to other environmental issuesensuring the Conservation of Biodiversity7.68 Conservation of biodiversity is crucial as it provides resources and services necessary forhuman beings and for the sustenance of all living beings. It enhances ecosystem productivity,where each species, however small, has an important role to play. May 22nd is celebrated asan International Day for Biological Diversity every year globally to create awareness amongthe citizens and stakeholders on the importance and need for the conservation of biologicaldiversity.7.69 India ranks eighth in the world and fourth in Asia among the mega-diverse countries inthe world. It is also rich in fauna, and nearly 62 per cent of the recorded amphibian species areendemic to India, which is majorly found in the Western Ghats. Globally, India holds the eighthposition for the origin and diversity of crop plants, as it has more than 300 wild ancestors andclose relatives of cultivated plants growing naturally. Notably, around 9,500 plant species areused as medicine in indigenous health practices. Moreover, local and indigenous people usemore than 3,900 plant species as food, fibre, fodder, insecticides and pesticides, gum, resins,dyes, perfumes, and timber. Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 2377.70 The 1992 Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro led to the adoption of an internationallybinding legal instrument, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with the objectivesof conservation, sustainable use, and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from theuse of biological diversity. The fifteenth meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP 15) to theConvention on Biological Diversity (CBD) took place between 7th and 19th December 2022 inMontreal, Canada. Key outcomes of the COP 15 include-• Effective conservation and management of at least 30 per cent of the world’s lands, inlandwaters, coastal areas, and oceans. Currently, 17 per cent and 10 per cent of the world’sterrestrial and marine areas are under protection.• Reduce to near zero the loss of areas of high biodiversity importance.• Cut global food waste in half and significantly reduce overconsumption and waste generation.• Reduce by half both excess nutrients and the overall risk posed by pesticides and highlyhazardous chemicals.• Progressively phasing out or reforming subsidies that harm biodiversity by 2030 by at leastUS$500 billion per year while scaling up positive incentives for biodiversity’s conservationand sustainable use.• Mobilise by 2030 at least US$ 200 billion per year in domestic and international biodiversity-related funding from all sources – public and private.• Raise international financial flows from developed to developing countries, in particular,least developed countries, small-island developing States, and countries with economies intransition, to at least US$ 20 billion per year by 2025 and to at least US$ 30 billion per yearby 2030.7.71 In conformity with the spirit of the CBD, India enacted the Biological Diversity Act in2002. The Act mandates the implementation of the objectives through a decentralised systemwith the National Biodiversity Authority at the national level, the State Biodiversity Boards atthe State level, and Biodiversity Management Committees at the local body level. Each of theseentities is a statutory and autonomous body with specific mandates and powers to facilitate theeffective implementation of the provisions of the Act and the Rules.7.72 India and Nepal signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in August 2022 onbiodiversity conservation to strengthen and enhance the coordination and cooperation in thefield of forests, wildlife, environment, biodiversity conservation, and climate change, includingrestoration of corridors and interlinking areas and sharing knowledge and best practices betweenthe two countries. The MoU would help promote cooperation between the Parties in the fieldof forests, wildlife, environment, biodiversity conservation, and climate change, includingrestoration of corridors and interlinking areas and sharing knowledge and best practices. 238 Economic Survey 2022-23Box vii.3: Project CheetahThe introduction of Cheetahs in India is being done under Project Cheetah, the world’s first inter-continental large wild carnivore translocation project. The cheetah was declared extinct from Indiain 1952. Under the scheme, eight Namibian wild cheetahs were introduced on 17 September 2022in Kuno National Park, Madhya Pradesh. Out of the eight Cheetahs, there are five female and threemale Cheetahs.The historic reintroduction of Cheetahs in India is part of a long series of measures for ensuringsustainability and environmental protection. Cheetahs can help restore open forest and grasslandecosystems in India. This will help conserve biodiversity and enhance the ecosystem services likewater security, carbon sequestration, and soil moisture conservation, benefiting society. This effort,in line with the Prime Minister’s commitment to environmental protection and wildlife conservation,will also lead to enhanced livelihood opportunities for the local community through eco-developmentand ecotourism activities.The Government has constituted a Task Force for monitoring Cheetah introduction. The Task Forceshall be in force for a period of two years. The Task Force has been formed to:• Review, progress, and monitor the health status of Cheetah, upkeep of the quarantine & softrelease enclosures, protection status of the entire area, adherence to the defined protocols byforest & veterinary officials, and advice on Cheetah introduction in India concerning overallhealth, behaviour and their upkeep.• Monitor hunting skills and adaptation of Cheetahs to the habitat of Kuno National Park.• Monitor the release of Cheetah from Quarantine bomas to soft-release enclosures, grassland, andopen forest areas.• Open Cheetah habitat for eco-tourism and suggest regulations in this regard.• Suggest and advise on developing tourism infrastructure in the fringe areas of Kuno NationalPark and other Protected Areas.Wildlife - its Preservation and Protection7.73 India has a rich heritage of wildlife and a long history and tradition of conservation. Theconcern for wildlife is, indeed, the concern for the man himself. All forms of life – human,animal and plants are so closely interlinked that disturbance in one leads to an imbalance inothers. A comprehensive legislation was enacted in 1972 called the Wildlife (Protection) Act1972 to provide special legal protection to our wildlife and the endangered species of fauna.7.74 Animals such as tigers, lions, and elephants are keystone and flagship species whosepreservation benefits the entire ecosystems. As of 10 August 2022, India is home to 53 TigerReserves covering approximately 75,796.8 sq. km area in 18 States, with about 75 per centof the wild tiger population at the global level. India achieved the goal of doubling the tigernumbers in 2018, four years before the targeted year 2022. In addition, 17 Tiger Reserves inthe country have CA|TS international accreditation, and two have received International Tx2Award15.15 The TX2 Tiger Conservation Award is given away by Conservation Assured | Tiger Standards (CA|TS), Fauna & Flora International, GlobalTiger Forum, IUCN Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme, Panthera, UNDP Lion’s Share, Wildlife Conservation Society, andWorld Wide Fund For Nature’s (WWF’s) Tigers Alive Initiative. Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 2397.75 Similarly, the population of Asiatic Lions has shown a steady increase, with a populationof 674 individuals (2020), 28.87 per cent (one of the highest growth rates so far) higher than the523 lions in 2015. India now (2020) has 12,852 leopards compared to the previous estimate of7910 conducted in 2014. More than a 60 per cent increase in population has been recorded. Thecurrent population estimates indicate about 50,000 – 60,000 Asian elephants worldwide. Morethan 60 per cent of the population is in India. Indian Elephant has also been listed in AppendixI of the Convention of the Migratory species in the Conference of Parties of CMS 13 at GandhiNagar, Gujarat, in February 2020.Figure vii.13: Success story of tiger conservation Figure vii.14: rising lion count over theefforts reflected in increased tiger count years, driven by various conservation efforts3000250020001500100050002006 2010 2014 2018sregitforebmuN70060050040030020010002005 2010 2015 2020snoilforebmuNSource: National Tiger Conservation Authority Source: Press Information Bureau release7.76 The Act has been amended multiple times to strengthen conservation measures andfulfil multilateral commitments on wildlife preservation. Targeting further reforms in wildlifeconservation, the government has brought in the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2022.The Act seeks to increase the number of species protected under the law and implement theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora16 (CITES).The Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 has six schedules. The Act aims to rationalise the schedulesby (i) reducing the number of schedules for specially protected animals to two, (ii) removingthe schedule for vermin species, and (iii) inserting a new schedule for specimens listed in theAppendices under CITES (scheduled specimens). Lastly, the Act empowers the government toregulate or prohibit the import, trade, possession or proliferation of invasive alien species.Plastic Waste management and elimination of identified Single-use Plastics7.77 India is committed to mitigating pollution caused by littered single-use plastics. Accordingto a report on Plastic Waste Management released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,the global average of plastic per capita consumption is 28 kg, and India has a per capita plasticconsumption of 11 kg. However, as an attempt to reduce pollution caused due to littered plasticwaste in the country, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government ofIndia, notified the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, on August 12, 2021. OnJuly 1, 2022, a ban was imposed on the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and16 CITES is an international agreement between governments to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants doesnot threaten the survival of the species. 240 Economic Survey 2022-23use of identified single-use plastic items, which have low utility and high littering potential, allacross the country. The measures will promote a circular economy, reduce the plastic footprintof plastic packaging, promote the development of new alternatives to plastic packaging andprovide the next steps for moving towards sustainable plastic packaging by businesses.7.78 The following domestic regulatory actions were taken in 2022:i. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notified the Guidelines onExtended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging vide Plastic Waste ManagementAmendment Rules, 2022, on 16 February 2022. The key highlights of the Guidelines onExtended Producers Responsibility (EPR) on plastic packaging notified on February 16,2022 are:(a) m andatory registration of Producers, Importers, and Brand Owners (PIBOs) andPlastic Waste Processors (PWPs) through a centralised online portal;(b) c overage of four categories of plastic packaging viz. rigid, flexible, multi-layeredplastic packaging, and compostable plastic packaging;(c) clearly defined targets for EPR;(d) m andatory targets for reuse of rigid plastic packaging, minimum level of recycling ofplastic waste and use of recycled plastic content in plastic packaging;(e) centralised online portal to support the implementation of EPR;(f) provision for the sale and purchase of surplus EPR certificates;(g) levy of environmental compensation for non-fulfilment of EPR obligations and(h) provision for verification, audit and monitoring of obligated entities.ii. The Plastic Waste Management (Second Amendment) Rules, 2022, were notified onJuly 6, 2022. The amendment aligns the rules with the Guidelines on Extended ProducerResponsibility for plastic packaging. The amendment provides a statutory frameworkfor biodegradable plastics after conforming to BIS Standards and the Central PollutionControl Board (CPCB) certification. The rules mandate that environmental compensationshall be levied based upon the polluter pays principle, on persons not complying withthe provisions of these rules, as per guidelines notified by the Central Pollution ControlBoard.7.79 The waste management infrastructure in the States/UTs is also being strengthened throughthe Swachh Bharat Mission. All States/UTs have constituted a Special Task Force for eliminatingsingle-use plastics and effectively implementing Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. ANational Level Taskforce has been formed by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and ClimateChange to make coordinated efforts to eliminate identified single-use plastic items and effectiveimplementation of Plastic Waste.7.80 The resumed session of the fifth United Nations Environment Assembly held in Nairobion 2 March 2022 adopted a resolution “End plastic pollution: towards an international legally Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future 241binding instrument”. India engaged constructively with all member states to develop aconsensus on the resolution for driving global action on plastic pollution. On the insistence ofIndia, the principle of national circumstances and capability17 while addressing plastic pollutionwas included in the resolution text to allow developing countries to follow their developmenttrajectories.Battery Waste management7.81 The Government published the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, on August 24,2022 to ensure environmentally sound management of waste batteries. Notifying these rules isa transformative step towards promoting the circular economy. New rules will replace Batteries(Management and Handling) Rules, 2001. The rules cover all types of batteries, viz. ElectricVehicle batteries, portable batteries, automotive batteries, and industrial batteries.7.82 The rules function based on the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR),where the producers (including importers) of batteries are responsible for the collection andrecycling/refurbishment of waste batteries and the use of recovered materials from wastesinto new batteries. EPR mandates that all waste batteries be collected and sent for recycling/refurbishment, prohibiting disposal in landfills and incineration. To meet the EPR obligations,producers may engage themselves or authorise any other entity to collect, recycle, or refurbishwaste batteries.e-waste management7.83 The Government notified the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, on November 2, 2022.These rules will replace the E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016, and will be effective fromApril 1, 2023. These rules will launch a new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regimefor e-waste recycling. The salient feature of new rules is as under:• Applicable to every manufacturer, producer, refurbisher, dismantler, and recycler who mustregister with CPCB. No entity shall carry out any business without registration and not dealwith any unregistered entity.• The authorisation has now been replaced by registration through an online portal, and onlymanufacturers, producers, refurbishers and recyclers require registration.• Schedule I has been expanded, and now 106 Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE)have been included under the EPR regime.• Producers of notified EEE have been given annual E-Waste Recycling targets based on thegeneration from the previously sold EEE or based on sales of EEE, as the case may be.• Management of solar PV modules /panels/ cells added in new rules.• The recycled quantity will be computed based on end-products to avoid false claims.• Provision for generation and transaction of EPR Certificate has been introduced.• Provisions for environmental compensation and verification & audit have been introduced.17 It was essential as not all countries are equally placed in terms of development and capabilities. 242 Economic Survey 2022-237.84 Under these rules, a provision for reducing hazardous substances in the manufacturingof EEE has been provided. It mandates that every producer of EEE and their components shallensure that their products do not contain lead, mercury, and other hazardous substances beyondthe maximum prescribed concentration. It also provides for recognition and registration, skilldevelopment, monitoring, and ensuring the safety and health of workers involved in dismantlingand recycling e-waste.Conclusion7.85 India is spearheading one of the world’s most ambitious clean energy transitions andremains steadfast in its commitment to combating climate change. Despite the adverse impactsof Covid-19 on the economy, India has enhanced its climate ambition manifold and embarkedon a long-term strategy towards a Low GHG Emission Development Strategy by adopting amulti-pronged approach.7.86 The energy transition plan is complemented by numerous policies intended to improve theecosystem to deploy promising technological innovations, like green hydrogen. The country hasconsistently modified/amended regulatory standards and adopted policy-level interventions tosupport the development and adoption of new technology. India’s progress on energy transitionmay be understood from the fact that it has enhanced its non-fossil fuel based installed capacitytarget to 50 per cent in its updated NDC as the target of 40 per cent of the first NDC wasachieved well in advance.7.87 The sustainable finance framework has also evolved from the initial steps covering thetop listed 100 companies required to conform to sustainability standards. The requirement hasnow not only been extended to 1000 top listed companies on a mandatory basis but also thesustainability standards have become much stronger and measurable that correspond to the bestpractices while taking into account the specific context of India.7.88 As mentioned earlier, resources have competing use, and development strategies are notsubstitutable. Modification in the development pathway has a transition cost, including socialand economic costs. India’s climate ambitions require resources to be dedicated to the cause ofclimate change, in addition to, what is needed for the country’s development goals. Obligationson climate should be matched with the on-time availability of climate finance, technology, andinputs like critical minerals, while not jeopardising the socio-economic development objectivesand aspirations.7.89 Even if India has so far undertaken climate actions on its own, the heightened expectationsof further large-scale climate measures have to be equated with the enhanced initiatives bydeveloped countries in terms of providing means of implementation, including finance,technology transfer, and capacity-building support.7.90 More importantly, the global climate agenda will advance if advanced countries can setexamples of policy and behavioural changes that work in their backyard and whose trade-offsare well recognised and accepted by their people. Then, it might be realistic to expect suchpolicies and behavioural expectations of households to succeed in developing countries withsuitable adaptation.****** AgrIculture And Food 08MAnAgeMent: FroM FoodsecurIty to nutrItIonAlCHAPTERsecurItyThe performance of the agriculture and allied sector has been buoyant over the pastseveral years, much of which is on account of the measures taken by the government toaugment crop and livestock productivity, ensure certainty of returns to the farmers throughprice support, promote crop diversification, improve market infrastructure through theimpetus provided for the setting up of farmer-producer organisations and promotion ofinvestment in infrastructure facilities through the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. Thechapter discusses these aspects while also focussing on other government interventions toenhance credit availability, facilitate mechanisation and boost horticulture and organicfarming.The chapter documents the performance of the animal husbandry, dairying and fisheriessectors, which are increasingly recognised as emerging sectors by way of performancerelative to the crop sector and their importance in the food basket and the farmers’incomes.The legislation-backed nationwide food management programme, the National FoodSecurity Act (NFSA), is discussed. To remove the financial burden of the poor, theGovernment has taken a decision to give free foodgrains to about 81.4 crore beneficiariesunder the NFSA for one year from January 1, 2023Introduction8.1 With its solid forward linkages, the agriculture and allied activities sector significantlycontributed to the country's overall growth and development by ensuring food security. TheIndian agriculture sector has been growing at an average annual growth rate of 4.6 per centduring the last six years. It grew by 3.0 per cent in 2021-22 compared to 3.3 per cent in 2020-21. In recent years, India has also rapidly emerged as the net exporter of agricultural products.In 2020-21, exports of agriculture and allied products from India grew by 18 per cent overthe previous year. During 2021-22, agricultural exports reached an all-time high of US$ 50.2billion. This period of buoyant performance could be ascribed to the measures taken by theGovernment to promote farmer-producer organisations, encourage crop diversification, andimprove productivity in agriculture through support provided for mechanisation and the creationof the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. Thus, enabling the country, in the spirit of Vasudhaiva 244 Economic Survey 2022-23Kutumbakam, to provide necessary and essential support to other countries for the losses facedduring Covid-19. Further, income support to farmers through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan SammanNidhi (PM-KISAN) and the promotion of allied activities has led to diversification in sources offarmers’ income, improving their resilience to weather shocks.Figure VIII.1: despite covid-19 shock agriculture and allied sector shows resilient growth8.0 6.8 6.65.56.04.0 3.3 3.02.00.6 2.1-0.20.02014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22-2.0tnecrepSource: MoSPI’s Annual and Quarterly Estimates of GDP at constant prices, 2011-12 series.8.2 The interventions of the Government have been in line with the recommendations of theCommittee on Doubling Farmers' Income, which had identified improvement in crop and livestockproductivity, diversification towards higher value crops, better resource efficiency, enhancedcropping intensity, improvement in real prices received by farmers and shift from farm to non-farm occupations as being significant sources of growth. Several policy measures, such as theMinimum Support Price (MSP) to secure the price at one and half times the all-India weightedaverage cost of production, schemes and price measures to focus on high-value added crops suchas oilseed, incentives for crop diversification through price policy measures, improvements inagricultural marketing and by enhancing resource use efficiency etc. have been adopted. WhileIndian agriculture has performed well, the sector needs re-orientation in the backdrop of certainchallenges like adverse impacts of climate change, fragmented landholdings, sub-optimal farmmechanisation, low productivity, disguised unemployment, rising input costs, etc.Various policy initiatives introduced and implemented to deal with these issues are discussedlater in this chapter.Figure VIII.2: crowding in of Private investment in agriculture12.010.0 9.3 9.6 9.38.58.07.58.0 6.9 6.8 6.6 7.06.0 5.4 5.34.7 4.8 4.6 4.9 4.7 4.9 4.3 4.34.02.00.02011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21tnecrepPublic PrivateSource: Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2021.

Production of pulses has also been notably higher thanthe average of 23.8 million tonnes in the last five years. However, as indicated earlier changingclimate has been impacting agriculture adversely. The year 2022 witnessed an early heat waveduring the wheat-harvesting season, adversely affecting its production. The year experienced adecline in the sown area for paddy cultivation too in the Kharif season due to delayed monsoonsand deficient rainfall. As per First Advance Estimates 2022-23 (kharif only) the paddy area wasabout 3.8 lakh hectares less than the sown area of 411.2 lakh hectare during 2021-22 (kharifseason). Further, in the current rabi season the area under rabi paddy has expanded by 6.6 lakhhectares as compared to last year (Crop Weather Watch Group 12 January 2023). As per theFirst Advance Estimates for 2022-23 (Kharif only), total food grains production in the country isestimated at 149.9 million tonnes which is higher than the average Kharif food grain productionof the previous five years (2016-17 to 2020-21). Despite a fall in the sown area of Kharif paddy,the total production of Kharif rice during 2022-23 is estimated at 104.9 million tonnes, whichis higher than the previous five years (2016-17 to 2020-21) average Kharif rice production of100.5 million tonnes.Figure VIII.4: sustained increase in Foodgrains Production in India (Million tonnes)40.0 310.7 315.7 350.0297.535.0 275.1 285.0 285.2 300.0252.0 251.530.0250.025.0200.020.0150.015.0100.010.05.0 50.00.0 0.02014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22sdeesliodnasesluPsennotnoillimsniargdooFlatoTsennotnoillimOilseeds Pulses Total FodgrainsSource: 1st Advance Estimates (2022-23) of DA&FW released dated 21.09.2022. 246 Economic Survey 2022-23MsP to ensure returns over the cost of Production8.4 The Union Budget for 2018-19 announced that farmers in India would be given an MSPof at least one and a half times the cost of production.

Accordingly, the Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) was introducedin 1998 for farmers to empower them to purchase agricultural products and services on creditat any time. As of 30 December, 2022, banks issued Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) to 3.89 croreeligible farmers with a KCC limit of ₹4,51,672 crore. With the Government of India extendingthe KCC facility to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers in 2018-19, the number of suchcards in the fisheries and animal husbandry sector has also grown. As of 17 October 2022, 1.0lakh KCCs have been sanctioned for the fisheries sector and 9.5 lakh (as of 4 November 2022)for the animal husbandry sector.8.6 To ensure that the farmers pay a minimal interest rate to the banks, the Government ofIndia has introduced the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS), now renamed Modified InterestSubvention Scheme (MISS), to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidised interest rates.Under this scheme, short-term agriculture loan up to ₹3 lakh is available at 7 per cent per annumto farmers engaged in Agriculture and other Allied activities, including Animal Husbandry, Agriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security 247Dairying, Poultry, Fisheries etc. An additional 3 per cent subvention (Prompt RepaymentIncentive) is also given to the farmers for prompt and timely repayment of loans. Therefore, if afarmer repays his loan on time, he gets credit at 4 per cent per annum.8.7 As a result of the initiatives taken and the measures to strengthen existing policies, therehas been a consistent increase in the agriculture credit flow over the years, exceeding the targetevery year for the past several years. In 2021-22 also, it was about 13 per cent more than thetarget of ₹16.5 lakh crore. The target for the flow of credit to agriculture for 2022-23 has beenfixed at ₹18.5 lakh crore.Figure VIII.6: Continued Increase in Institutional Credit to Agriculture Sector (₹ lakh crore)200 18.618015.816013.9140 12.611.6120 10.79.2100 8.58060402002014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22)erorChkal₹(Source: Based on data from DAFW and Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2021.Farm mechanisation- Key to Improving Productivity8.8 Farm mechanisation helps increase productivity through timely and efficient use of otherinputs and natural resources while at the same time reducing the cost of cultivation and thedrudgery associated with various farm operations. Under the Sub Mission on AgriculturalMechanisation (SMAM), State Governments are being assisted in training and demonstratingagricultural machinery and helping farmers procure various farm machinery and equipmentbesides setting up Custom Hiring Centres (CHC). As of December 2022, 21628 CHCs and 467Hi-Tech hubs and 18306 farm machinery banks have been established. Increasing fragmentationof farm holdings (with the average size of household ownership holdings declining from 1.23 hain 2005-06 to 1.10 ha in 2010-11 and further to 1.08 ha in 2015-16) requires machines that areviable and efficient for small farm holdings 1.chemical-free India: organic and natural Farming8.9 Organic and natural farming provides chemical fertiliser and pesticide-free food grainsand other crops, improves soil health and reduces environmental pollution. India has 44.3 lakhorganic farmers, the highest in the world, and about 59.1 lakh ha area was brought under organicfarming by 2021-22. Sikkim voluntarily adopted going organic, and the process of getting thetotal cultivable land of 58,168 hectares under organic farming commenced at ground level in1Agriculture Statistics at a glance 2021 248 Economic Survey 2022-232010. It became the first State in the world to become fully organic, and other States, includingTripura and Uttarakhand, have set similar targets.8. 10 The Government has been promoting organic farming by implementing two dedicatedschemes, i.e., Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value ChainDevelopment for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) since 2015 through cluster/ FarmerProducer Organisations (FPOs) formation. PKVY Scheme is being implemented in a clustermode (with min. 20 ha size). Financial assistance of ₹50,000 per ha for three years is providedto the farmer, out of which ₹31,000 is given as incentives for organic inputs provided directlythrough Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). Under PKVY as of 16 November 2022, 32,384 clusterstotalling 6.4 lakh ha area and 16.1 lakh farmers have been covered. In addition, as part ofthe Namami Gange Programme, a 1.2 lakh ha area has been covered under organic farming.MOVCDNER is dedicated to promoting organic farming of niche crops of the North EastRegion through FPOs. Under the MOVCDNER, 177 FPOs/FPCs have been created, covering1.5 lakh farmers and 1.7 lakh hectares.8. 11 Promotion of natural farming began in 2019-20, when Bhartiya Prakratik Krishi Paddhati(BPKP), a sub-scheme of PKVY, was launched to assist farmers in adopting traditionalindigenous practices for encouraging all forms of ecological farming, including Zero-BudgetNatural Farming (ZBNF). The scheme focuses on capacity building, training, handholding,and on-field demonstration of natural farming through champion farmers. Under the BPKP,4.09 lakh ha of land have been brought under Natural farming in 8 States (Andhra Pradesh,Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu).other Important Initiatives in Agriculture8.12 PM KISAN Scheme: It is a Central Sector Scheme to supplement the financial needs ofland-holding farmers. The financial benefit of ₹6,000 per year is transferred into the bankaccounts of farmer families through DBT. It is one of the largest DBT schemes in the world.About 11.3 crore farmers were covered under the Scheme in its April-July 2022-23 paymentcycle. The Scheme, through a span of over 3 years, has successfully provided assistance of morethan Rs. 2 lakh crore to crores of needy farmers. Many studies and findings indicate that thePM KISAN scheme has helped farmers towards productive investment in agricultural activities.This, through a multiplier effect, has contributed to the overall improvement of the farm sector.For instance, in an empirical2 study with the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR),the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) found that the scheme has enabledaddressing the liquidity constraints of farmers for buying agricultural inputs. Further, for thesmall and marginal farmers, it has helped them meet their requirement of funds for farm inputsand their daily consumption, education, health and other incidental expenses.8. 13 Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF): AIF is a financing facility operational from the year2020-21 to 2032-33 for the creation of post-harvest management infrastructure and communityfarm assets, with benefits including 3 per cent interest subvention and credit guarantee support.Under this, a provision of ₹1 lakh crore for 2020-21 to 2025-26 has been made, and interest2Varshney, Deepak; Joshi, Pramod Kumar; Roy, Devesh; and Kumar, Anjani. 2020.

AIF scheme has thefacility of convergence with any other scheme of the State or Central Government and can proveto be a milestone in investment in the agriculture sector.Since its inception, an amount of ₹13,681 crore has been sanctioned for agriculture infrastructurein the country, covering more than 18,133 projects. These include 8,076 warehouses, 2,788primary processing units, 1,860 custom hiring centres, 937 sorting & grading units, 696 coldstore projects, 163 assaying units and around 3613 other kinds of post-harvest managementprojects and community farming assets.8.14 Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY): PMFBY is currently the largest cropinsurance scheme in the world in terms of farmer enrolments, averaging 5.5 crore applicationsevery year and the third largest in terms of the premium received. The scheme promises minimalfinancial burden on the farmer, with farmers paying only 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the totalpremium for the Rabi and Kharif seasons, respectively, with Centre and State Governmentsbearing most of the premium cost. During the last six years of its implementation, farmers paida premium of ₹25,186 crore and received claims amounting to ₹1.2 lakh crore (as of 31 October2022). The acceptability of the scheme amongst the farmer can be ascertained from the fact thatthe share of non-loanee, marginalised, and small farmers have increased by 282 per cent sincethe scheme’s inception in 2016.Box VIII.1: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima yojana (PMFBy)• PMFBY was launched in the 2016 Kharif season to provide comprehensive insurancecoverage to farmers in case of crop failure, helping stabilise their incomes. The scheme isimplemented through empanelled general insurance companies. It is modified/revamped on atimely basis considering the prevailing policy regime and requirement of policy interventionin crop insurance in the country. The Scheme covers all Food & Oilseeds crops and AnnualCommercial/Horticultural Crops for which past yield data is available and for which therequisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) are being conducted under the GeneralCrop Estimation Survey (GCES). The revamped Scheme w.e.f Kharif 2020 has many features,which include voluntary participation for all farmers, selection of Insurance Companies by theStates for 3 years in a go, a two-step process of crop yield estimation, use of smart samplingtechnique through satellite data for crop cutting experiments, etc.• The scheme is implemented on an ‘Area Approach’ basis. Admissible claims are workedout and paid directly to the insured farmer’s account by the insurance companies on theyield data based on the requisite number of CCEs per unit area furnished to the concernedinsurance. However, losses due to localised risks of hailstorms, landslides, inundation, etc., arecalculated on an individual-insured farm basis. These claims are assessed by a joint committeecomprising representatives of the State Government and concerned insurance companies. 250 Economic Survey 2022-23• PMFBY is currently the largest crop insurance scheme in the world in terms of farmerenrolments, averaging 5.5 crore applications every year and the third largest in terms ofpremiums received. In the last six years of its implementation, farmers have paid a premiumof ₹25,186 crore and received claims amounting to ₹1.26 lakh crore (as of 31st October 2022).The increase in acceptability of the scheme amongst the farmer can be ascertained from thefact that the share of non-loanee, marginalised and small farmers increased by 282 per centsince the scheme's inception in 2016. During the arduous seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019marred by weather extremities, the scheme proved to be a decisive factor in securing thelivelihoods of farmers, wherein the claims paid ratio in several states averaged more than 100per cent against the gross premium collected. For example, the States of Chhattisgarh (2017),Odisha (2017), Tamil Nadu (2018), and Jharkhand (2019) received 384 per cent, 222 per cent,163 per cent and 159 per cent of claims ratio against a gross premium.• To better resolve grievances within the scheme, National Crop Insurance Portal has beendeveloped to handle all grievances from end to end. This portal is equipped with the necessaryfeatures, such as Complaint/Query capturing through multiple modes, farmer authentication& online ticket forwarding to the concerned company, online escalation as per escalationmatrices, updating of resolution details, MIS & Dashboards for data analysis. It has API-basedconnectivity to the insurance companies and is well-designed, ensuring that every grievanceis taken to a logical conclusion to the farmer's satisfaction. Along with this, the redressal ofcomplaints within the prescribed time limits is monitored through the portal by the concernedState and Central Government officials. The Beta version of the portal was launched inChhattisgarh on 21st July 2022.• Further, a provision of Stratified Grievance Redressal Mechanism, viz. District LevelGrievance Redressal Committee (DGRC), State Level Grievance Redressal Committee(SGRC) has been made in the Revised Operational Guidelines of the Scheme to resolve suchcomplaints.8.15 Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH): Several expert groups haveidentified horticulture as a high-growth area and a source of buoyant income and improvedresilience for farmers. The scheme to promote horticulture covering fruits, vegetables, root andtuber crops, spices, flowers, plantation crops etc., was introduced in 2014-15. The interventionsinclude introducing improved varieties and quality seeds, incentives for plantation crops, clusterdevelopment, and post-harvest management. According to third advance estimates (2021-22),a record production of 342.3 million tonnes in an area of 28.0 million hectares was achieved.The government has identified 55 horticulture clusters, of which 12 have been selected for theCluster Development Programme (CDP) pilot phase. This programme is designed to leveragethe geographical specialisation of horticulture clusters and promote integrated and market-leddevelopment of pre-production, production and post-harvest activities, including the entiresupply chain.8.16 National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) Scheme: The Government of India launchedthe National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) Scheme in 2016 to create an online transparent,competitive bidding system to ensure farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. Under Agriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security 251the e-NAM Scheme, the Government provides free software and assistance of ₹75 lakh perAPMC mandi for related hardware, including quality assaying equipment and the creation ofinfrastructure like cleaning, grading, sorting, packaging, compost unit, etc. As on 31 December2022, more than 1.7 crore farmers and 2.3 lakh traders have been registered on e-NAM portal8.17 Climate-Smart Farming Practices: This is slowly gaining acceptance with farmers usingclean energy sources like solar for irrigation. The farmers have been incentivised to transferelectricity generated through solar to the local grid. Crop yield prediction models using artificialintelligence and drones for monitoring soil and crop health have been initiated. Smart farmingalso enables crop diversification, which will help farmers reduce their dependence on monsoonsfor water. There are over 1,000 agritech start-ups in India. These assist farmers in improvingfarming techniques 3.Box VIII.2: International year of the Millets: our traditional staple and ahealthier alternativeSource: Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers WelfareThe United Nations General Assembly, in its 75th session during March 2021, declared 2023the International Year of Millets (IYM). Millets are Smart Food with high nutritional value,are climate resilient, and align with several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).These are also important by virtue of their mammoth potential to generate livelihood, increasefarmers’ income and ensure food & nutritional security all over the world.3www.investindia.gov.in/team-india-blogs/digitalization-agriculture-india 252 Economic Survey 2022-23India produces more than 50.9 million tonnes (as per fourth advance estimate) of millet whichaccounts for 80 per cent of Asia’s and 20 per cent of global production. The global averageyield is 1229 kg/ha, whereas India has a higher average yield of 1239 kg/ha. In India, milletsare primarily a Kharif crop mostly grown in rainfed conditions, requiring less water andagricultural inputs than other staple crops.Given the nutritional value of the millets, the Government notified Millets as Nutri-cereals inApril 2018. Under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), millets have been introducedto provide nutritional support. A sub-mission on Nutri-cereals is being implemented since2018-19 in 212 districts of 14 States.India has more than 500 start-ups working in the millet value chains, while the IndianInstitute of Millets Research has incubated 250 start-ups under Rashtriya Krishi VikasYojana – Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sectors Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR).Allied sectors: Animal Husbandry, dairying and Fisheries catching up inrecent years8.18 The allied sectors of Indian agriculture - livestock, forestry & logging and fishing &aquaculture are gradually becoming sectors of buoyant growth and a potential source of betterfarm incomes. The livestock sector grew at a CAGR of 7.9 per cent during 2014-15 to 2020-21 (at constant prices), and its contribution to total agriculture GVA (at constant prices) hasincreased from 24.3 per cent in 2014-15 to 30.1 per cent in 2020-21. Similarly, the annualaverage growth rate of the fisheries sector has been about 7 per cent since 2016-17 and has ashare of about 6.7 per cent in total agriculture GVA. Higher growth in allied sectors comparedto the crop sector has obvious implications in terms of the increasing importance of the formerin total agricultural GVA. Recognising the growing importance of allied sectors, the Committeeon Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI, 2018) considers dairying, livestock, poultry, fisheries andhorticulture as high-growth engines and has recommended a focussed policy with a concomitantsupport system for the allied sector.Figure VIII.7: th ough the crop sector is still the major contributor to agriculture gVA, thelivestock sector is catching up (per cent)70.0 65.4 64.5 64.4 62.260.0 59.1 58.4 60.0 55.9 55.8 55.150.040.030.020.010.00.0srotceSdeillAdnaporCfoAVGLivestock Forestry & logging Fishing and aquaculture CropsSource: Based on data of MoSPI.

Other livestockproducts, such as eggs and meat, are also growing in importance. While India ranks first in milkproduction in the world, it ranks third in egg production and eighth in meat production in theworld.8.20 Cognisant of the importance of allied sectors, the Government has made several criticalinterventions to enhance infrastructure and improve livestock productivity and disease control.As a part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat (ANB) stimulus package, the Animal HusbandryInfrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) worth ₹15,000 crore was launched in 2020. Underthis scheme, the Central Government provides a 3 per cent interest subvention to the borrowerand credit guarantees up to 25 per cent of total borrowing. As of 14 October 2022, 116 projectshave been approved under the scheme involving project costs of ₹3,731.4 crore. NationalLivestock Mission (NLM) scheme has been restructured for 2021-22 to 2025-26. The schemefocuses on entrepreneurship development and breeds improvement in poultry, sheep, goatand piggery, including feed and fodder development. Also, the Livestock Health and DiseaseControl (LH&DC) Scheme is being implemented to supplement the State/UT governments’efforts towards preventing, controlling and containing animal diseases of economic and zoonoticimportance by vaccination. National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) is beingimplemented to control Foot & Mouth Disease and Brucellosis by completely vaccinating cattle,buffalo, sheep, goat and pig populations against Foot & Mouth Disease and bovine femalecalves of 4-8 months of age against brucellosis.8.21 In May 2020, as a part of the ANB package, the Government of India launched its flagshipscheme Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), with a total outlay of ₹20,050 crore.PMMSY marks the highest-ever investment in the fisheries sector in India, to be implementedover five years from FY21 to FY25 in all States/Union Territories to drive sustainable andresponsible development of the fisheries sector while ensuring socio-economic developmentof the fishers, fish farmers and fish workers. Before this, attention had been paid to addressinginfrastructure gaps in the fisheries sector. A dedicated Fisheries and Aquaculture InfrastructureDevelopment Fund (FIDF) was established for five years, from 2018-19 to 2022-23, with aninvestment of ₹7,522 crore. Under the FIDF, as of 17 October 2022, proposals to the tune of₹4,923.9 crore have been approved and have benefitted over 9.4 lakh persons, through directand indirect employment, in fishing and allied activities.sahakar-se-samriddhi: From cooperation to Prosperity8.22 The cooperative societies, especially in the agriculture, dairy and fisheries sectors, providethe rural population with livelihood opportunities and a financial safety net with a community-based approach. Cooperatives hold the key to rural economic transformation. There are 8.5 lakhregistered cooperatives in the country, having more than 29 crore members mainly from themarginalised and lower-income groups in the rural areas, and 98 per cent of villages are coveredby Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS).8.23 To realise the vision of “Sahakar-see-Samriddhi”, a renewed impetus was given to thegrowth of the cooperative sector. Currently, around 19 per cent of agriculture finance is through 254 Economic Survey 2022-23cooperative societies. A full-fledged Ministry of Cooperation was established in July 2021 toprovide greater focus to the cooperative sector. In addition, the Government has taken variousinitiatives to promote and strengthen PACS, like the computerisation of 63,000 functional PACSand the preparation of by-laws for enabling PACS to expand their activities.8.24 The Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002 (MSCS) was enacted after repealingthe Multi-State Cooperative Act 1984, to facilitate the democratic functioning and autonomousworking of Multi-State Cooperative Societies in line with the established Cooperative Principles.As of date, there are 1528 registered societies under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act2002. The MSCSs include 66 Multi-State Cooperative Banks with deposits of approx. ₹2.6 lakhcrore. Maharashtra leads 661 cooperatives, followed by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.Figure VIII.8: top ten states with Multi-state cooperative societies as on 20 october 2022700 661600500400300159 156200 12672 69100 42 29 29 280seiteicoSfo.oNARTHSARAHAM IHLED HSEDARPRATTUUDANLIMATNAHTSAJAR LAGNEBTSEWTARAJUG AKATANRAK HSEDARPAYHDAMALAREKBox VIII.3: new national cooperation PolicyWith the view to strengthening the cooperative movement in the country, deepening its reachto the grassroots, and promoting cooperative-based economic development, a New NationalCooperation Policy is being formulated involving the relevant stakeholders such as experts ofthe cooperative sector, representatives from National/ State/ District/ Primary level cooperativesocieties, Secretaries (Cooperation) and Resident Commissioners from States/UTs, officersfrom Central Ministries/ Departments. The objective is to have a policy that unlocks the truepotential of the Cooperation sector.In addition, the Government has also decided to introduce the Multi-State Co-operativeSocieties (Amendment) Bill, 2022. The Bill seeks to amend the Multi-State Co-operativeSocieties Act, 2002, to bring it in line with Part IXB of the Constitution and to strengthenthe cooperative movement in the country by bringing in provisions relating to electoralreforms, strengthening governance and transparency, reforming the composition, meetingsand membership of board; enabling the raising of funds by co-operative sector, strengtheningmonitoring mechanism, enhancing ‘Ease of doing business’, etc. The bill was introduced inthe Lok Sabha on 7 December 2022 in the winter session of Parliament. Agriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security 255Food Processing sector-the sunrise sector8.25 The food processing sector is of enormous significance for India's development becauseof the strong connections and interactions it promotes between industry and agriculture. Duringthe last five years ending FY21, the food processing industries sector has been growing at anaverage annual growth rate of around 8.3 per cent. As per the latest Annual Survey of Industries(ASI) 2019-20, 12.2 per cent of persons in the registered manufacturing sector were employedin the food processing sector. The value of agri-food exports, including processed food exports,was about 10.9 per cent of India's total exports during 2021-22.8.26 With the growing importance of processed food items in the consumer basket, newhorizons are now open for both the agriculture and the industry sector pushing diversificationand commercialisation in farming, improvement in the efficiency of resource use, enhancementin the income of farmers, expansion in the avenues to export agro foods and generation ofemployment opportunities. Optimum development of the food processing sector will contributesignificantly to tackling several developmental concerns such as disguised rural unemploymentin agriculture, rural poverty, food security, food inflation, improved nutrition, prevention ofwastage of food etc.8.27 To facilitate the unfettered growth of the food processing sector, there is a continuousneed for extensive investment in cold chain infrastructure and address logistical challenges.The NITI Aayog Strategy for New India identifies the lack of adequate and efficient coldchain infrastructure as a critical supply-side bottleneck that leads to massive post-harvestlosses (mostly of perishables) estimated at ₹92,561 crore annually4 . The uneven geographicdistribution of cold storage infrastructure also contributes to regional-level disparities. Giventhat countries worldwide have stringent guidelines for importing food and agricultural products,the probability of exports from India getting rejected increases with the lack of adequate coldchain infrastructure. Further, logistical barriers relating to connectivity also pose supply-sidechallenges. For instance, Indian national highways, while accounting for 2 per cent of the totalroad network, carry 40 per cent of all cargo – exemplifying the burden on the existing roadnetworks and potential for congestion, which is detrimental to food (and particularly perishables)transport.8.28 Recognising the abundant potential of the sector, the Government has been at the forefrontwith various interventions aimed at the development of food processing in the country. TheMinistry of Food Processing Industries, through the component schemes of Pradhan MantriKisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY), provide financial assistance for the overall growth anddevelopment of the food processing sector. Under PMKSY, 677 projects have been completedtill 31 December 2022. The Ministry also launched in 2020 the Prime Minister's Formalisationof Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME) Scheme as part of the ANB Abhiyan toenhance the competitiveness of individual micro-enterprises in the unorganised segment andpromote the formalisation of this sector by providing financial, technical and business supportfor upgradation/setting up of 2 lakh micro units in the country. As of 31 December 2022, 15,095loans of ₹1402.6 crore were sanctioned. The scheme adopts the One District One Product4Niti Aayog, New Strategy for India @75, Dec 2018, chapter 7, page 36. 256 Economic Survey 2022-23(ODOP) approach to reap the benefit of scale in procuring inputs, using shared services andmarketing products. So far, 713 Districts with 137 unique products were approved under theODOP in 35 States/ UTs.8.29 The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing Industry (PLISFPI),launched in March 2022, has the specific mandate to incentivise investments to create globalfood champions. Sectors with high growth potential, like marine products, processed fruits &vegetables, and ‘Ready to Eat/ Ready to Cook’ products, are covered for support. In phase -I,149 applications have been selected for assistance under the PLISFPI. Subsequently, a PLIScheme for millet-based products was also introduced with an outlay of ₹800 crore. In phase-II,33 applications (both organic and millet products) have been selected.8.30 To focus on transporting perishable food products, including horticulture, fishery, livestockand processed products, from the Hilly Areas, North-Eastern States and Tribal Areas, KrishiUDAN 2.0 version was launched in October 2021 as a six-month pilot project. The AirportsAuthority of India (AAI) provides a full waiver of Landing, Parking, Terminal NavigationalLanding Charges (TNLC) and Route Navigation Facility Charges (RNFC) for Indian freightersand P2C (Passenger-to-Cargo) aircraft. The scheme covers around 25 airports focusing on NorthEastern, Hilly and Tribal regions and 28 airports in other regions/areas. Thus, the scheme assistsfarmers in transporting agricultural products and improves value realisation.Food security- social & legal commitment to the People of the nation8.31 Food security is not only a question of the ability to produce food but also of the abilityto access food. The Government is currently running the most extensive legislation-basedfood security programme in the world, covering about 80 crore of India's population underthe National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. The food management programme in Indiacomprises procurement of food grains from farmers at remunerative prices, distribution offood grains to consumers, particularly the vulnerable sections of society, at affordable pricesand maintenance of food buffer stock for food security and price stability. Till December2022, the NFSA provided, for coverage of up to 75 per cent of the rural and up to 50 per centof the urban population highly subsidised food grains at ₹1/2/3 per kg for coarse grains/wheat/rice, respectively, at the rate of 35 kg per family per month to households coveredunder Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and at the rate of 5 kg per person per month to priorityhouseholds. In a recent decision, the government has decided to provide free foodgrains toabout 81.35 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA for one year from January 1, 2023. Toremove the financial burden of the poor, the government will spend more than ₹2 lakhcrore in this period on food subsidies under NFSA and other welfare schemes. Under this,the Government will provide 5 kg of foodgrains per person to Priority Households (PHH)beneficiaries and 35 kg per household to Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) beneficiaries(poorest of the poor) free of cost for the next year.8.32 Procurement from farmers for this programme is at MSP. During Kharif Marketing Season(KMS) 2021-22, 581.7 lakh metric tons (LMT) of Rice was procured against an estimated targetof 532.7 LMT. In the current year, KMS 2022-23, a total of 355 LMT of rice has been procuredup to 31 December 2022. Also, during Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2022-23, 187.9 LMT Agriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security 257wheat was procured against 433.4 LMT procured during RMS 2021-22. The procurement waslower as the market price of wheat was higher than its MSP during its procurement season.During 2022-23, the Government of India allocated 970.1 lakh tons of foodgrains to States/UTsunder NFSA and Other Welfare Schemes, etc.Figure VIII.9: Allocation of Foodgrains under nFsA and other Welfare schemes in 2022-23 andas of 1 January 2023 (lMt)700600.22600500400 358.833002001005.53 5.550NFSA (including ICDS & PM GKAY Allocations Covid Allocation (Non Other WelfarePM-POSHAN) (VI & VII Phase) NFSA, OMSS Cost) Measures +Additionalof Allocation atEconomic CostnothkalSource: Department of Food and Public Distribution.8.33 To ease the hardships faced by the poor due to economic disruption caused by Covid-19,the Government initially launched Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) forthe period from April to June 2020. However, keeping in view the need for continuous supportto the poor and the needy, the scheme has been extended and implemented in various phases(Phase VII is the latest covering October-December,2022). Under the scheme, 5 kg of additionalfood grains per person per month has been/is being provided free of cost to NFSA beneficiariesin all the phases. Under the PM-GKAY scheme ( covering all phases), the Government hasallocated about 1,118 LMT foodgrains to the States/UTs.8.34 To further ease the process of access to food, the Government launched a citizen-centricand technology-driven scheme in 2019 called the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC)scheme. The ONORC system enables intra-State and inter-State portability of ration cards. Ithelps the migrant beneficiaries access their food security entitlements from any fair price shop(FPS) of their choice by using the same ration card after biometric/Aadhaar authentication onelectronic Point of Sale (e-PoS) devices at the FPS. Presently, the national/inter-State portabilityis enabled in all 36 States/UT, covering 100 per cent of the total NFSA population.8.35 The food subsidy bill was higher during 2020-21 and 2021-22 in comparison to other yearsas a result of the free food distribution programme of the government under the PMGKAY. Thisdedicated support was provided to ensure that the farmers and vulnerable households remainedprotected from the Covid-19 led shocks. 258 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure VIII.10: total Food subsidy released by the government of India since 2014-15.(In ₹ thousand crore)600.0 529.7500.0400.0288.7300.0171.1 164.1200.0 113.2 134.9 130.7 140.0100.00.02014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22)erorcdnasuoht₹(Source: Based on data received from DFPDNote: i.

Investment in the sector must be encouraged through an affordable, timelyand inclusive approach to credit delivery. Intervention by the Government through PM Kisanto provide income support, strengthening of institutional finance and insurance through thePMFBY and the push given to Kisan Credit Cards as also access to machines and tools thatimprove productivity have been significant. A focus on the horticulture sector and the thrusttowards allied activities have diversified farmers’ income making them more resilient to weathershocks. All these initiatives have led to sustainable and inclusive development of the sector.8.37 A greater focus on the development of the food processing sector can reduce wastage/loss and increase the length of storage, ensuring better prices for the farmers. The initiativeslike e-NAM and the Promotion of FPOs formation have been introduced to strengthen theagricultural market. With the interventions including PMKSY, PMFME, PLI, etc., attempts havebeen made to boost the food processing industries to harness its linkages with the agriculturesector. A well-developed food processing sector with improved infrastructure like cold storageand better logistics helps reduce wastage, improve value addition, ensure better farmers' returns,promote employment, and increase export earnings. 09INDUSTRY: STeaDYCHAPTERRecoveRYThe industry holds a prominent position in the Indian economy contributing about 30percent of total gross value added in the country. In FY23, the Indian industry facedsome extraordinary challenges as the Russian-Ukraine conflict broke out. That led to asharp rise in the prices of many commodities. Prices of edible oil, crude oil, fertilisersand food grains rose sharply. They remained at elevated levels for several months. Therisk of another round of supply chain disruptions emerged, but they were not as severeas feared. Nonetheless, both the price and the availability of essential commodities hadthe potential to dent the industry’s optimism on consolidating the recovery of FY22 andfurther accelerating it. It is fair to say that the Indian industry acquitted itself rather wellunder trying circumstances. Overall Gross Value Added (GVA) by the Industrial Sector,based on data available for the first half of the FY23, rose 3.7 per cent, which is higherthan the average growth of 2.8 per cent achieved in H1 of the last decade.Robust domestic conditions since FY22 have provided a demand stimulus to industrialgrowth. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23was the highest among all half years, H1 or H2, since FY15. Further, the strong exportperformance of FY22 continued somewhat in the first half of FY23. In this half of theyear, exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16.However, the performance began to wane in the first half itself as the Year-on-Year (YoY)growth of exports declined from Q1 to Q2 due to persistently high inflation and risinginterest rates in the advanced economies. The increase in investment demand has emergedas another powerful stimulus to industrial growth. It has been triggered by the augmentedcapex of the central government in the current and the previous year as compared to thepre-pandemic years. The leap also has crowded in private investment, already upbeat onthe pent-up demand, export stimulus, and strengthening of the corporate balance sheets.The supply response of the industry to the demand stimulus has been robust, as seen inhigh-frequency indicators. PMI manufacturing has remained in the expansion zone for18 months since July 2021, and its sub-indices indicate an easing of input cost pressures,improving supplier delivery times, robust export orders, and future output. While growthin the consumer durables component of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is onaccount of the release of ‘pent-up’ demand, the increase in capital goods and infrastructure/construction goods is indicative of the beginnings of a virtuous investment cycle that isexpected to be led by the private sector. The growth of the eight core industries of coal,fertilisers, cement, electricity, steel, and refinery products has held steady, reflecting abroad momentum in industrial activity. However, the manufacturing landscape furthershows uneven growth across various categories, with industries such as automobiles and 260 Economic Survey 2022-23electronics registering impressive performances while sectors such as textiles have beenshowing tepid growth, as export demand for these products has been mellowing with theslowing of global output and demand.Industrial activity has been supported by an upswing in bank credit to the sector. Creditto industry started recovering from the beginning of the year and has been growing indouble digits since July 2022. Credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase inpart, assisted by the introduction of the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme(ECLGS). While the growth in total credit has been driven by an increase in creditdemanded by MSMEs, large industries have begun to increase the pace of their creditofftake too since the beginning of FY23 as they look to reduce their pace of capital raisingfrom volatile debt and equity markets. The robust growth in credit demand combinedwith rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscores businesses’optimism regarding future demand.Amidst heightened global uncertainty, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in themanufacturing sector moderated in the first half of FY23. However, inflows stayed wellabove the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving theease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in theworld.The electronics industry continues to ascend in importance as its applications becomepervasive. Electronics, supported by continuously improving communication services, willsignificantly enhance productivity, efficient service delivery, and social transformation.This industry’s significant growth drivers are mobile phones, consumer electronics, andindustrial electronics. In the mobile phone segment, India has become the second-largestmobile phone manufacturer globally, with the production of handsets going up from 6crore units in FY15 to 29 crore units in FY21.The Indian Pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticalsindustry. India is ranked 3rd worldwide in the production of pharma products by volumeand 14th by value. The sector is the largest provider of generic medicines globally,occupying a 20 per cent share in global supply by volume, and is also the leading vaccinemanufacturer globally with a market share of 60 per cent. The performance of pharmaexports has been robust, sustaining positive growth despite the global trade disruptionsand drop in demand for Covid-19-related treatments. The cumulative FDI in the pharmasector crossed the US$ 20 billion mark by September 2022.The pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have demonstrated the risk of supply chainshocks to the global economic order. As companies adapt their manufacturing and supplychain strategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a globalmanufacturing hub this decade. In this context, the government’s Make-in-India initiativehas facilitated investment, fostered innovation and built world-class infrastructure whileaddressing the gaps in domestic manufacturing capabilities. The Production LinkedIncentive (PLI) schemes across 14 categories has further complemented it with anestimated Capex of around ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential togenerate over 60 lakh jobs. In the medium term, the scheme will help reduce net importsby building domestic manufacturing capacity that will cater to domestic and global needs. Industry: Steady Recovery 261Introduction9.1 Industry holds a prominent position in the Indian economy, accounting for 31 per cent ofGDP, on average, during FY12 and FY21 and employing over 12.1 crore people. The sector’srelevance can be identified through various direct and indirect linkages with other sectors,contributing to economic growth and employment. First, it ensures that domestic productioncan accommodate domestic demand and reduces the reliance on imports. Thereby assistingin the improvement of trade and current account balances. Second, industrial growth hasmultiplier effects, which translates into employment growth. Some industries, such as textilesand construction, have high employment elasticities. Third, industrial growth spurs growth inservices sectors such as banking, insurance, logistics, etc.Table IX.1: Growth and Share of Industrial components (in Per cent)Real Gva Real GvaGrowth in Per centgrowth in growth in Share in totalH2:FY23 FY23 over FY23 over Gva FY23H1:FY23(estimated) FY22 FY20Industry 3.7 4.5 4.1 11.1 30.0Mining & quarrying 2.2 2.6 2.4 4.4 2.3Manufacturing 0.1 3.0 1.6 11.0 17.3Electricity, gas, watersupply & other utility 10.0 7.9 9.0 13.0 2.3servicesConstruction 11.5 7.3 9.1 12.8 8.1overall Gva 9.0 4.7 6.7 9.8 -Source: National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)Note: Data for FY23 presents the First Advance Estimates9.2 Industrial production is a means to increase industrial income in the country. As measuredby industrial GVA, growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GVA growth in theeconomy since the pre-pandemic year of FY20. Manufacturing GVA, which contributes morethan 50 per cent of industrial GVA, has grown at an even higher rate when compared to overallGVA. In FY23, the Industry sector witnessed modest growth of 4.1 per cent compared to thestrong growth of 10.3 per cent in FY22. This is likely on account of input cost-push pressures,supply chain disruptions and the China lockdown impacting the availability of essential inputsand slowing the global economy. The fading away of the base effect must have also weighedon growth in FY23. On a positive note, estimates of H2:FY23 shows improvement in overallindustrial growth, especially in the manufacturing sector, both yearly and sequentially. Easinginput prices and conducive demand conditions will support growth, ceteris paribus.9.3 In this chapter, the survey will review the performance of the Indian industry in the currentfinancial year. It explores the demand stimulants to industrial growth, the supply response of theindustry, trends in credit to the industry and foreign investment in India’s industrial sector. Thechapter also addresses the developments in key sub-industries and their challenges. Towardsthe end, it evaluates India’s aspirations and prospects of becoming a key player in global valuechains. 262 Economic Survey 2022-23Demand Stimulus to Industrial Growth9.4 FY23 began with the month-old Russian-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of relenting.As the year draws to a close, the conflict appears to have plateaued, although global commodityprices are yet to deescalate to their pre-pandemic levels. Industry, throughout the year, hasthus faced high input costs imported into the country. Fearing demand impact, the industry hasbeen gradually passing on the higher production costs, which has led to sticky but non-risingcore retail inflation. Non-core retail inflation, on the other hand, comprising food and energycomponents, has been declining as local weather extremities have eased and interventions bythe government to restrict price rises have proven effective. The consequent decrease in overallretail inflation has thus sustained the pent-up consumer demand in the post-pandemic Indianeconomy, inducing an industrial recovery despite the global headwinds. With world commodityprices now also on a downward trajectory and showing up in declining rates of India’s wholesaleinflation, core retail inflation is expected to relent, making domestic consumption demand muchstronger to further induce industrial growth in the country. PFCE as a share of GDP in H1 ofFY23 was the highest since FY15.9.5 Strong external demand also served the Indian industry well in FY22 when manufacturedexports soared, responding to a rebound in global growth. Trade had also recovered and grown asbottlenecks in global supply chains eased. The export stimulus for the Indian economy persistedin the first half of FY23. In this half of the year, exports of goods and services as a share ofGDP have been the highest since FY16. However, the export impulse has been waning in thefirst half itself as the YoY growth of exports has declined from Q1 to Q2 due to persistentlyhigh inflation and rising interest rates in the advanced economies. Export growth may slowfurther in the second half of the current financial year and remain weak beyond that, too, if theglobal economy falls into recession. However, the strong domestic consumption growth andinvestment revival is expected to keep industrial production humming.9.6 Indeed, an increase in investment demand has emerged as another powerful stimulus toindustrial growth. It has been triggered by a jump in the Capex of the central government inthe current and the previous year as compared to the pre-pandemic years. The leap also hascrowded-in private investment, already upbeat on the pent-up consumption demand, exportstimulus, and strengthening of the corporate balance sheets. Capacity utilisation at 74.3 percent in Q1 of FY23 has already reached the tipping point of 75.3 per cent in Q4 of FY22, atwhich investments in building new capacities are undertaken. New Investment announced in themanufacturing sector during April-December of FY23 was five times the corresponding level inFY20. The surge in investment is also attributable to the policy actions taken by the Governmentover the past several years. A beginning has been made in H1 of FY23, which recorded thehighest share of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in GDP among all half-years sinceFY15.

This has roots in the first decade of the new millennium when a creditboom financed rising levels of investment rates. Consequently, by the time the second decade began,the balance sheets of both the corporates and banks became stressed. As a result, corporates switchedfocus from investment to deleveraging while banks slowed credit disbursement in view of high Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). Consequently, the investment rate declined, and the economy began toslow. Midway into the second decade, the problems were identified, and mitigation measures wereinitiated. For the banks, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was instituted to resolve theirstressed assets while the equity base of public sector banks was strengthened. For the corporates, theGoods and Services Tax (GST) rollout improved their ease of doing business while the corporate taxrate was slashed to increase their profits/ investible reserves for financing investment. During thepandemic, the implementation of ECLGS lent additional support to the MSMEs. Maturing digitalinfrastructure and easy and cheap data access have further enriched the investment climate.Figure a: Deleveraging by private non-financial sector120100806040PDGfotnecreP50-nuJ 60-nuJ 70-nuJ 80-nuJ 90-nuJ 01-nuJ 11-nuJ 21-nuJ 31-nuJ 41-nuJ 51-nuJ 61-nuJ 71-nuJ 81-nuJ 91-nuJ 02-nuJ 12-nuJ 22-nuJCore debt of private non-financial sectorSource: Bank for International Settlements (BIS)Note: Credit to the non-financial sector captures the borrowing activity of the private non-financial sector. 264 Economic Survey 2022-23Deleveraging has strengthened the corporate balance sheets, as evident in the declining core debt ofthe private non-financial sector. Credit to the private non-financial sector as a percentage of GDPin India had come down from a peak of 113.0 per cent in December 2010 to a low of 83.8 per centin December 2018. This shows that de-leveraging was completed by the end of 2018. With theelections out of the way in May 2019 and with corporate tax cuts announced in September 2019,it would have resulted in an improvement in investment and economic growth cycles, but it wasdelayed due to the disruption caused by the pandemic for two years. Deleveraging resumed from thebeginning of FY22 as core debt of the private non-financial sector decreased to 87.8 per cent of GDPin the June 2022 quarter from 100.7 per cent in the March 2021 quarter on the back of improvedcorporate performance and a recovery in GDP levels.During H1:FY23, the interest coverage ratio was 5, higher than its five-year (FY20) average of 3.The debt-equity ratio also declined from 0.8 to 0.4. These improvements have further absorbed theincrease in working capital requirements triggered by volatility in global commodity prices andsupply chain disruptions. On the other hand, profit margins peaked in the second half of FY21 aslow inflation kept input costs from rising while restricted mobility reduced overheads. Subsequently,profit margins started to decline as input costs rose on the back of rising global commodity prices.With global commodity prices declining, input costs are set to fall, and profit margins are expectedto increase. Expected increases in profits and strengthened balance sheets have made the corporatesector financially stronger and optimistic about increasing net sales. The Reserve Bank of India’s(RBI) Industrial Outlook Survey conducted during July-September 2022 points towards optimismabout production, order books, employment, and profit margins for the period covered until Q1 ofFY24.Figure B: Net Sales expected to rise Figure c: Profit Margins Improving806040200-20-40YoY,tnecreP81YF:2H 91YF:1H 91YF:2H 02YF:1H 02YF:2H 12YF:1H 12YF:2H 22YF:1H 22YF:2H 32YF:1H8084030-2-40-7-12 -80YoY,tnecreP81YF:2H 91YF:1H 91YF:2H 02YF:1H 02YF:2H 12YF:1H 12YF:2H 22YF:1H 22YF:2H 32YF:1HYoY,tnecrePNet ProfIt MarginsOperating Expenses (RHS) Industry: Steady Recovery 265Figure D: Liquidity and Gearing Ratios Figure e: capacity Utilisation and Businessmarginally healthier expectation10 0.60.580.460.340.220.10 0oitaR81YF:2H 91YF:1H 91YF:2H 02YF:1H 02YF:2H 12YF:1H 12YF:2H 22YF:1H 22YF:2H 32YF:1HoitaRInterest Cover Debt-Equity Ratio (RHS)80 1601407012060100508040 60tnecreP91YF:1Q 91YF:3Q 02YF:1Q 02YF:3Q 12YF:1Q 12YF:3Q 22YF:1Q 22YF:3Q 32YF:1Q 32YF:3QxednICapacity Utilisation BEI (RHS)Source: Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Source: RBI(CMIE) Note: BEI stands for Business Expectation IndexThe credit boom in the first decade increased the banking sector advances to the non-financial sectorfrom 36.5 per cent of GDP in 2004 to 57.3 per cent in 2014 (Bank for International Settlements). Thisled to the RBI imposing a more stringent assessment of NPAs. Consequently, NPAs rose from 4.3 percent of gross bank advances in FY15 to 11.2 per cent in FY18. However, with the enforcement of theIBC code and a more disciplined approach to credit disbursements, NPA fell to 7.3 per cent in FY21and to a seven-year low of 5.0 per cent in September 2022. The Capital-to-Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio(CRAR) and provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) have also improved and stood at 16.0 per cent and71.5 per cent, respectively, in September 2022. With well-capitalised banks ready and willing to lendand corporates financially stronger and willing to borrow, the credit-investment cycle is poised for anupturn in the third decade.Supply Response of Industry9.7 The supply response of the industry to the demand stimulus has been robust, as seenin high-frequency indicators. The PMI-Manufacturing, for example, has remained in theexpansionary zone for 18 months since July 2021. In December 2022, the sub-indices of thePMI-Manufacturing indicated an easing pace of input cost pressures, improving supplierdelivery times, robust export orders, and future output. The moderation in input cost inflationhas also led to an easing in the momentum of output prices. However, the pace of expansion innew export orders decreased, reflecting a subdued global demand.9.8 The sustained growth of manufacturing output is also seen within the overall IIP producingconsumer durables in sync with the “pent-up” consumption demand. Robust growth in theproduction of capital goods and infrastructure/construction goods is indicative of the beginningsof an investment cycle in the private sector in the next financial year. 266 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure IX.2: PMI Manufacturing remains in Figure IX.3: Sub-indices of IIP growing at aexpansionary zone healthy pace (apr-Nov)706050403020xednI02-raM 02-nuJ 02-peS 02-ceD 12-raM 12-nuJ 12-peS 12-ceD 22-raM 22-nuJ 22-peS 22-ceD15013011090705030Manu Capital Infra/ Consumerfacturing goods construction DurablesgoodsxednIFY21 FY22 FY23Source: IHS Markit Source: MoSPI9.9 The eight core industries of coal, fertilisers, cement, steel, electricity, refinery products,crude oil, and natural gas are critical in meeting the demand for inputs across industries.

Seasonality has contributed to constraining the growth of production inrespect of mining and quarrying, and construction, as total rainfall in Q2 of FY23 was about 12per cent higher than in Q2 of FY22. Further, as higher rainfall cooled temperatures, electricitydemand fell, and hence output rose by less than 5 per cent in Q2 of FY23 over Q2 of FY22.

A typical cycle of change-in-stocks juxtaposed withthe growth of manufacturing GVA (a proxy for manufacturing output) suggests that the build-up of stock allows manufacturing to slow its pace with the accumulated stock meeting currentdemand. When stocks start shrinking, manufacturing output increases to meet current demandand replenish stocks before the onset of the next cycle. Stock build-up appears to have thusplayed an important role in keeping the growth of manufacturing output restrained in Q2.Figure IX.6: Gva Manufacturing slowing with build-up in stocks and elevated global uncertainty8 0.66 0.44 0.22 0.00 -0.2erorChkaL₹91-nuJ 91-peS 91-ceD 02-raM 02-nuJ 02-peS 02-ceD 12-raM 12-nuJ 12-peS 12-ceD 22-raM 22-nuJ 22-peSerorChkaL₹Real GVA Manufacturing Change in stocks (RHS)Moderation instocking andmanufacturingUseof stock toamid uncertainsupportRestocking externaldemand supported by increased demandmanfuacturing outlookSource: MoSPI; Note: Change in stocks refers to change in stocks of GFCF.9.12 The manufacturing landscape shows uneven growth across various categories. Forexample, the motor vehicles manufacturing segment’s performance continues to improve,induced by robust demand and an easing of chip shortage. The manufacturing of ‘computer,electronic and optical products’, an upcoming industry, has also been rising. Multiple playerslooking to make India a manufacturing hub of semiconductors have made the investment outlook 268 Economic Survey 2022-23in this sector positive. Production of coke and refined petroleum has also increased, fetchinghigh returns in a global market where crude oil prices were higher than in FY22. Chemicalsand chemical products such as caustic soda, soda ash, fertilisers and petroleum products havealso performed well, contributing to sustaining the growth momentum in the agriculture sectorwhile increasing exports. At the same time, a few product categories, including textiles, appareland leather, have been showing tepid growth, as export demand for these products has beenmellowing with the slowing of global output and demand.

While a large share of bank credit continues to be assigned tolarge industries, credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase in part assisted by theintroduction of the ECLGS, which supports around 1.2 crore businesses of which 95 per centare MSMEs 1. The impact of ECLGS on increasing the growth of credit to MSME was felt mostduring the pandemic impacted years of 2020 and 2021. It continued in 2022 as the scheme wasextended to March 2023. Furthermore, growth in credit to MSME was buttressed by reboundingconsumption levels, particularly in the services sector. Consequently, the share of MSMEs ingross credit offtake to the industry rose from 17.7 per cent in January 2020 to 23.7 per centin November 2022. While the growth in total credit has been driven by an increase in creditdemanded by MSMEs, large industries have also begun to increase the pace of their credit offtakesince the beginning of FY23. With the spread between corporate bond yields and marginal costsof funds-based lending rate (MCLR) narrowing, and the volatility in the corporate bond marketremaining high, corporates appear to be shifting their sources of financing from bond marketsto bank capital, where rates have remained stable and predictable. Robust growth in creditdemand combined with rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscoresbusinesses’ optimism regarding future demand.Figure IX.7: Double-digit credit growth in Industry driven by MSMes403020100-10tnecreP12-naJ 12-beF 12-raM 12-rpA 12-yaM 12-nuJ 12-luJ 12-guA 12-peS 12-tcO 12-voN 12-ceD 22-naJ 22-beF 22-raM 22-rpA 22-yaM 22-nuJ 22-luJ 22-guA 22-peS 22-tcO 22-voNMSME Large Industry Non Food CreditSource: RBI1 As per the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd.

It jumped from US$ 12.1 billion in FY21 to US$ 21.3 billion in FY22as the pandemic-driven expansionary policies of advanced economies led to a surge in global Industry: Steady Recovery 271liquidity. With the rise in global uncertainty in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, FDIequity inflow in manufacturing in the first half of FY23 fell below its corresponding level inthe first half of FY22. The monetary tightening at the global level has further restricted the FDIequity inflows. A rebound in FDI inflows is, however, expected as the Indian economy sustainsits high growth while monetary tightening the world over eventually eases with the weakeningof inflationary pressures.Figure IX.8: Sector-wise FDI equity Inflows in 2022-23 during april-September 20221%Services4%7%Computer Software & Hardware22%5%Telecommunications5%TradingAutomobile18% Construction (Infra) ActivitiesChemicals (Other Than Fertiliser)34%4% Drugs & Pharma.OthersSource: DPIIT data9.16 Notwithstanding an overall drop in FDI in the first half of FY23, inflows have stayedabove the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the easeof doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world. Thegovernment has implemented an investor-friendly FDI policy under which FDI up to 100 percent is permitted through automatic route in most sectors. India continues to open up its sectors toglobal investors by raising FDI limits, removing regulatory barriers, developing infrastructure,and improving the business environment.Box IX.2: FDI Policy Reforms to bolster Investment• India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits and removingregulatory barriers to attracting increased investments, in addition to developing infrastructureand improving the business environment. To make India a more attractive investment destination,the Government has implemented several radical and transformative FDI reforms across sectorssuch as Defence, Pension, e-commerce activities etc.• In FY20, 100 per cent FDI under automatic route was permitted for the sale of coal, and coalmining activities, including associated processing infrastructure, subject to provisions of relevantacts. 26 per cent FDI under the government route has been permitted for uploading/ streamingof News & Current Affairs through Digital Media. 100 per cent FDI has been permitted inIntermediaries or Insurance Intermediaries, including insurance brokers, reinsurance brokers,insurance consultants, corporate agents, third-party administrators, Surveyors and Loss Assessorsand such other entities as may be notified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authorityfrom time to time. 272 Economic Survey 2022-23• To curb opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the Covid-19 pandemic,the government amended the FDI policy, according to which an entity of a country which sharesa land border with India or where the beneficial owner of investment into India is situated inor is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route. Further, in theevent of the transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in an entity in India, directly orindirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the restriction/purview of the saidpolicy amendment, such subsequent change in beneficial ownership will also require governmentapproval.• To simplify the approval process of foreign Investment and to promote ease of doing business,the erstwhile Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) was abolished in May 2017, and anew regime has been put in place. Under the new regime, the process for granting FDI approvalshas been simplified, wherein the work relating to the processing of applications for FDI hasbeen delegated to the concerned Ministries/ Departments, and DPIIT is the nodal department forfacilitating the process.• A revamped portal, “Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal (FIF Portal)”, has been launched asthe online single-point interface of the Government of India for investors to facilitate ForeignDirect Investment.

Some of the measures undertakeninclude the modification of the definition of MSMEs; the provision of ₹20,000 crore subordinatedebt for stressed MSMEs, ₹50,000 crore equity infusion through Self Reliant India fund; thewaiving of the global tender requirement for procurement of up to ₹200 crore; launching of theUdyam portal for MSME registration, a paperless, zero-cost registration portal that is based onself-declaration and only requires Aadhaar. Registrations on the Udyam portal crossed the one-crore mark in August 2022, surpassing the total registration done in the past 14 years under theold regime in just 2.5 years. As of 7th January 2022, the portal has a total registration count of 1.32crore, of which 1.27 crore have been classified as micro-enterprises. Enterprises registered onthe portal employ 9.6 crore people, of which 2.3 crore are women. There are 1.5 lakh exportingunits, which have contributed a cumulative ₹9.7 lakh crore worth of exports.9.19 The government’s initiative of the Samadhaan Portal, set up under the Micro, Small andMedium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act to monitor the outstanding dues to the MSMEsector, is helping MSMEs in resolving their cashflow difficulties. As of 7th January 2022, theportal has received a total of 1.3 lakh applications, of which 16.8 per cent have been disposedwhile 25.0 per cent are currently under consideration, and 25.1 per cent have been rejected. Inorder to fast-track this process, the government has instructed Central Public Sector Enterprises(CPSEs) and all companies with a turnover of ₹200 crore or more to get themselves onboardedon the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform for facilitating the discountingof trade receivables of MSMEs through multiple financiers. CHAMPIONS, the single-windowgrievance redressal portal for MSMEs launched by the Ministry of MSME in June 2020, hasreceived 56,825 grievances as of 16th January 2023, of which 55,878 grievances have beenresponded to. The portal continues to be improved through initiatives such as the localisation ofthe portal in 11 regional languages and the introduction of a Chatbot.9.20 The government has also initiated the ‘Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance’scheme (RAMP) in FY23. The World Bank-supported scheme aims at strengthening institutionsand governance at the Centre and State, improving Centre-State linkages and partnerships andimproving access of MSMEs to market and credit, technology upgradation and addressing issuesof delayed payments and greening of MSMEs. The RAMP programme will be implementedover a period of five years. The total outlay for the scheme is ₹6,062.4 crore, out of which₹3750 crore would be a loan from the World Bank, and the Government of India would fund theremaining ₹2312.4 crore.9.21 The bouquet of measures introduced by the government aided the resilience of the MSMEsector. Data from the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Corporation (NCGTC) shows that as of30th November 2022, 1.2 crore MSME units availed the ECLGS scheme and raised collateral-free resources to the tune of ₹3.6 lakh crore. A recent CIBIL report2 showed that 83 per cent ofthe borrowers who availed of the ECLGS were micro-enterprises, and more than half of theseborrowers had an exposure of less than ₹10 lakh. The NPA rate in banks for the category ofMSME borrowers who availed of ECLGS was lower than the category that did not avail of thescheme.

Electronics, supportedby continuously improving communication services, will significantly enhance productivity,efficient service delivery, and social transformation. The domestic electronics industry, as ofFY20, is valued at US$118 billion. India aims to reach US$300 billion worth of electronicsmanufacturing and US$ 120 billion in exports by FY263, supported by the vision of a US$ 1trillion digital economy by 2025. Improvement in manufacturing and export over the past fiveyears ensures that India is on the right trajectory to achieve this target. Electronic goods wereamong the top five commodity groups exhibiting positive export growth in November 2022,with the exports in this segment growing YoY by 55.1 per cent.9.23 The major drivers of growth in this industry are mobile phones, consumer electronics, andindustrial electronics. In the mobile phone segment, India has become the second-largest mobilephone manufacturer globally, with the production of handsets going up from six crore units inFY15 to 31 crore units in FY22. These numbers are expected to improve as more domestic andglobal players set up and expand their bases in India. Two major global and domestic players inelectronic manufacturing services have already embraced the PLI scheme4.

Hence, this will further enhance export competitiveness and increase India’sparticipation in the global value chain. The industrial electronics sector is also seeing growthdue to improved digitisation and robotics applications in Industry 4.0. Additionally, the impetuson Smart Cities and the Internet of Things (IoT) will streamline the demand for smart andautomated electronics.Figure IX.12: Robust growth in electronics exports1613.8128.98 7.45.95.23.940FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23Apr-NovnoilliB$SUSource: DGCI&S9.24 Some of the initiatives and incentives provided by the government to nurture andenhance the electronics manufacturing base include the PLI scheme for Large Scale ElectronicsManufacturing, the PLI scheme for IT hardware, the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing ofElectronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS). Additionally, under the Programme forDevelopment of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India, the Cabinetapproved the comprehensive development of a sustainable semiconductor and display ecosystemin the country with an outlay of ₹76,000 crore, the details of which are in Box 3. These schemesand initiatives are expected to boost India’s manufacturing capacity, reduce import dependence,and also contribute to achieving the country’s ambitions of becoming a major player in globalsupply chains.Box IX.3: Incentives to encourage semiconductor manufacturingin the US and IndiaThe global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the frailties in the supplychains of many goods and services. One product that was under the spotlight was the semiconductor(more commonly referred to as ‘chips’), and the effect of its shortage was particularly amplified inthe automotive industry globally. While the situation has limped back to normalcy, it has prompteda policy response by countries towards diversifying the semiconductor supply chain. 276 Economic Survey 2022-23One of the most notable policies is the United States’ Creating Helpful Incentives to ProduceSemiconductors and Science Act, 2022 (CHIPS and Science Act, 2022). The legislation aims tocatalyse investments in the domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity of the US. The countryproduces about 10 per cent of the world’s semiconductors and relies heavily on East Asia to importchips. The CHIPS and Science Act directs US$ 280 billion in spending over the next ten years, withthe bulk of it going to Research and Development (R&D).Figure a: Incentives under the cHIPS and Science act, 2022Tax Credits Leading edge tech9% and wirelesssupply chains1%Manufacturing19%R&D71%Source: whitehouse.gov.in; McKinsey and Co.In the pursuit of Aatmanirbharta and with the objective of plugging itself into the global valuechain, India has announced multiple incentives to attract investment for developing a semiconductormanufacturing ecosystem. To this end, a comprehensive programme with an outlay of ₹76,000crore (approx. US$ 10 billion) was approved by the Government of India in September 2022. Thegovernment will provide financial support for 50 per cent of the capital expenditure to be incurredby the investing firms.Table a: various incentives under Semiconductor SchemeScheme for Financial Support R&D Support50 per cent of firm’s Up to 2.5 per cent ofSetting up of Semiconductor Fabs in IndiaCapex the scheme outlay50 per cent of firm’s Up to 2.5 per cent ofSetting up Display FabsCapex the scheme outlaySetting up of Compound Semiconductors / Silicon50 per cent of firm’s Up to 2.5 per cent ofPhotonics / Sensors Fab and SemiconductorCapex the scheme outlayATMP /OSAT facilitiesSource: MEITYNote: ATMP stands for assembly, testing, marking, and packaging.

The scheme’s objectives include the nurturingand facilitation of domestic companies of semiconductor design, achieving significant indigenisationof semiconductor products and IPs deployed across the country, and strengthening the infrastructurefor design. The scheme will provide financial support of 50 per cent of eligible expenditure onthe design, subject to a ceiling of ₹15 crore per applicant and a deployment-linked incentive of4 per cent to 6 per cent of net sales achieved over five years, subject to a ceiling of ₹30 croreper applicant.While these are early stages, global and domestic players have evinced interest based on the prospectsfor the semiconductor industry in India and the fiscal incentives provided. Israel-based InternationalSemiconductor Consortium has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to invest ₹ 22,900crore in Karnataka to set up India’s first chip-making plant. Domestic players such as Vedanta andTata have also indicated plans to establish semiconductor fabs in the country.CoaI Industry: Key in maintaining energy self-reliance during uncertain times9.25 At the beginning of the fiscal year, coal availability became a challenge for India’s largelythermal-based power generation plants because of a resurgence in economic activity and theemergence of intense heat waves from early March to mid-May of 2022, increasing the demandfor power in the country. In addition, in the wake of rising international coal prices, the powersector curtailed coal import drastically from 69 MT in FY20 to 45 MT in FY21 and further to27 MT in FY22. As domestic coal production could not keep pace with its rising demand frompower-generating plants, its availability got limited. Resultantly, in April 2022, even as coalofftake rose to meet higher demand, coal stock with power plants, as on 31st April 2022, fell to8 days from 12 days a year ago.9.26 The government of India undertook several steps on a priority basis through April andMay of 2022 to address the supply constraints of coal. First, all generators were asked to importcoal to the extent of 10 per cent of their requirements (as against 4 per cent earlier). Penalties,including curtailment of domestic coal entitlements, were announced if power plants failed toimport coal. Second, Section 11 of the Electricity Act 2003 (Act) was invoked to direct importedcoal-based plants to run at full capacity with the assurance that their enhanced cost of operationwould be compensated. Third, tolling was enabled, which allowed states to transfer their allottedcoal to private generators near the mines instead of transporting it too far away from stategenerators. This move eased the burden on the availability of railway rakes. Fourth, RuralElectrification Corporation (REC)/ Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and commercial bankswere advised to facilitate the availability of additional working capital to power generatingplants. 278 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure IX.13: adequate coal Production Figure IX.14: Improving coal Stock807060504030Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov DecsennoTdnasuohTFY20 FY2120FY22 FY231612840syaDfo.oNnaJ beF raM rpA yaM nuJ luJ guA peS tcO voN ceD2021 2022Source: Ministry of Coal Source: National Power PortalNote: Production by Coal India Limited (CIL), SingareniCollieries Company Ltd (SCCL) and Captives/Others9.27 Well-timed measures have placed India in a better position to cater to excess energydemand. The coal production for FY23 is estimated to increase to 911 million tonnes, about17 per cent higher compared to the previous year. In April-December, 2022, coal productionrose by 14 per cent on a YoY basis and was 21 per cent higher than the pre-pandemic of FY20.Further, the coal stock at power plants improved to 12 days as of 30 December 2022 comparedto 10 days on 30 June 2022 and 8 days a year ago.9.28 Different measures have been initiated towards achieving self-reliance in coal production,including private participation in coal production, FDI under the automatic route, auctioning ofcoal blocks for commercial production, expansion of existing mines and opening of new mines,greater use of mass production technology in mining, mechanisation of loading, developmentof evacuation infrastructure etc.9.29 The coal industry is expected to grow at 6-7 per cent annually to reach a productionlevel of 1 billion tonnes by FY26 and about 1.5 billion tonnes by 2030. The enhanced domesticcoal production is expected to meet domestic coal demand, replace substitutable imports, andescalate exports. There has also been a persistent effort to improve system capacity utilisationfrom about 80 per cent to above 90 per cent.Re-invigorated infrastructure sector & construction activity to drive steel industry.9.30 Steel Sector plays a pivotal role in crucial sectors such as construction, infrastructure,automobile, engineering and defence. Over the years, the steel sector has witnessed tremendousgrowth. The country is now a global force in steel production and the 2nd largest crude steelproducer in the world. The steel sector’s performance in the current fiscal year has been robust,with cumulative production and consumption of finished steel at 88 MT and 86 MT, respectively,during April-December 2022, higher than the corresponding period during the previous four Industry: Steady Recovery 279years. The growth in finished steel production is aided by double-digit growth in consumption(11 per cent on a YoY basis), bolstered by a pick-up in the infrastructure sector significantlydriven by increased Capex of the government.9.31 Further, 67 applications from 30 companies have been selected under the PLI Schemefor speciality steel. This will attract a committed investment of ₹42,500 crore, with an increasein capacity by almost 26 million tons and an employment generation potential of nearly 70,000people. Further, domestic steel makers’ stable credit profiles, deleveraged balance sheets, androbust cash accrual support continue to support their capex. Iron and steel exports moderatedin the first eight months of the current fiscal owing to a slowdown in the global economy,particularly in Europe and China, and export duty levied to enhance domestic availability. Yet,iron and steel exports are higher by 20 per cent over the corresponding pre-pandemic levels ofFY20.Figure IX.15: Increasing Steel Production and Figure IX.16: a slight moderation in Iron andconsumption (apr-Dec) Steel exports during FY2390807060504030Steel Consumption Steel ProductionsennoTnoilliM20FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY231612840FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23Apr-NovnoilliB$SUSource: Joint Plant Committee (JPC), Ministry of Steel Source: DGCI&S9.32 In the future, the government’s thrust towards infrastructure projects, pick-up inconstruction and real estate activity, and healthy demand from the automobile sector augur wellfor the demand for steel products.

In the current financial year, the textile industry hasbeen facing the challenge of moderating exports compared to FY22. However, the levels in theeight six months still prevail, 9.5 per cent higher than the corresponding pre-pandemic level ofFY20. Export of readymade garments registered a growth of 3.2 per cent YoY basis during thesame period. FDI inflows into the textile sector are yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. 280 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure IX.17: export of Textiles moderated,Figure IX.18: FDI equity inflows in Textile yetwhile there is an uptick in Readymadeto RecoverGarment exports (april-Nov)1612840Textiles Readymade garmentsnoilliB$SUFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 250200150100500FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23Apr-SepnoilliM$SUSource: Dept. of Commerce Source: DPIIT9.34 To develop integrated large-scale and modern industrial infrastructure facilities for theentire value chain of the textile industry, the government approved the setting up of sevenPM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks. The parks will notonly reduce logistics costs and improve the competitiveness of Indian Textiles but also boostemployment generation, attract domestic investment and FDI, and position India firmly in theglobal textile market. The parks are expected to create a total of one lakh direct and two lakhindirect employment.9.35 Further, to boost the production capacity, the government launched the Textile PLIScheme with an approved outlay of ₹10,683 crore over five years starting from 1st January 2022to promote investments and increase the production of Man-Made Fibre (MMF) Apparel, MMFFabrics and Products of Technical Textiles. This will enable the textile sector to achieve size andscale, enhancing export competitiveness. In the approved 64 applications so far, the proposedtotal investment commitment is ₹19,798 crore, with projected turnover and employmentgeneration of ₹1.9 lakh crore and 2.5 lakh, respectively.Growth momentum in pharmaceuticals industry sustains after the pandemic9.36 The Indian Pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticalsindustry. India’s domestic pharmaceutical market is estimated at US$ 41 billion in 2021 and islikely to grow to US$ 65 billion by 2024 and is further expected to reach US$ 130 billion by20305. India is ranked 3rd worldwide in the production of pharma products by volume and 14thby value. The nation is the largest provider of generic medicines globally, occupying a 20 percent share in global supply by volume, and is the leading vaccine manufacturer globally with amarket share of 60 per cent.5 https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1660739 Industry: Steady Recovery 281Figure IX.19: Strong growth in Figure IX.20: High inflow of FDI in thepharmaceutical exports Pharma Sector201816141210FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23Apr-DecnoilliB$SU8006004002000FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23Apr-SepnoilliM$SUX 4Source: DGCI&S Source: DPIIT9.37 Indian pharmaceutical exports achieved a healthy growth of 24 per cent in FY21, drivenby Covid-19-induced demand for critical drugs and other supplies made to over 150 countries.The performance of pharma exports in FY22 has been robust, sustaining growth despite theglobal trade disruptions and drop in demand for Covid-19-related treatments. Carrying forwardthis growth momentum, drug and pharmaceutical exports during April-October 2022 was 22per cent higher than the corresponding pre-pandemic period of FY20. Cumulative FDI in thepharma sector crossed the US$ 20 billion mark in September 2022. Further, FDI inflows haveincreased four-fold over five years until September 2022, to US$ 699 million, supported byinvestor-friendly policies and a positive outlook for the industry.Figure IX.21: Three PLI Schemes to boost Manufacturingcapacity in the Pharmaceutical SectorCritical KSMs/DIs/APIs Medical Devices PharmaceuticalsCritical KSMs/DIs/APIs Medical Devices Pharmaceuticals• Tenure:FY21 to FY30 • Tenure: FY21 to FY28 • Tenure: FY21 to FY29• • O Teu nt ula ry e: : F₹ Y6, 29 14 0 to c Fro Yre 30 • • O Teu nt ula ry e: : ₹ F3 Y,4 22 10 t oc r Fo Yre 28 • • O Teu nt ula ry e: : ₹ F1 Y5 2,0 10 t0 o c Fr Yor 2e 9• • P 2O 0r u 2o t 2g la ,r ye 5s : 1 s ₹ : a 6 pU , p9n l4 it ci 0l a D c nr toe sc re • • P 2O 0r u 2o t 2g la ,r ye 2s : 1 s ₹ : a 3 pU , p4n l2 it ci 0l a D c nr toe sc re • • P 2O 0r u 2o t 2g la ,r ye 5s : 5 s ₹ : a 1 pU 5 pn , l0 it ci 0l a 0J n u c tsn r oe r e• aP pr po rg or ve es ds : wU itn ht i cl oD me mc itted • aP pr po rg or ve es ds : wU itn ht il Dec • aP pr po rg or ve es ds : wU itn ht i l aJ cu tun aeli2 n0 v2 e2 s, t m51 e na tp p ol fi c ₹a 4n ,1ts 3 8.4 c2 o0 m22 m, i2 tt1 e da p ip nl vic ea sn tmts e nt of i2 n0 v2 e2 s, t m55 e na tp p ol fi c Ra sn t 1s 8 ,669ca rp op rr eo .ved with committed Rap sp 1ro ,0v 5e 8d . 9w 7i t ch r ore. ca rp op rr eo .ved with actual• E ei cn mrm ov pre p e ls o.lt om yy me mn et ne n to tf g : ₹ eE n4 s e, t1 ri am3 t8 ia o. t4 ne d • Ec Ro m sm 1pm ,l 0oi 5t yt 8e md .9 e 7i nn ctv : r e oEs rst em t .imen at t eo df • Ei cn rm ov re p es .lt om ye mnt e no tf :R Es s t1 im8, a6 t6 e9 demployment generation employment generation• fErommp l5o1y mpreonjetc: tEs sitsi m ated • fE rom mp l 2o 1y m pre on jet c: tE s s oti fm ated • fE rom mp l 5o 5y m pre on jet c: tE s s :t i matedemployment generation10,598 persons. ae rm op ul no dy m 6,e 4n 1t 1 g pe en re sr oa nti so .n 2em 0,p 0l 0o 0y m die ren ct t g ae nn de r 8a 0ti ,o 0n 0 0from 51 projects is• F 10in ,5a 9n 8c i pa el ri sn oc ne sn .tive: NA • Ffr io nm an 2 c1 ia p l ro inje cc et ns tio vf e : The if nro dm ire 5 c5 t jp or bo sje .cts :around 6,411 persons. 20,000 direct and 80,000• Financial incentive: NA•f Fi in na an nci ca ilali n ince cn et niv tievea :t Tth hee• F ini dn ia ren cc ti a jol bI sn .centive: onrate of 5 per cent on incremental sales underif nin ca rn emcia el n ti an lc e sn at li ev se o a f t the • vF ain ria on uc si a cal tI en goce rin esti v ae t : onmrateed iocfa l5 dpeevr icceens t foonr 5 vin ac rr ye im nge n rt aa tl e s oa vl ee rs tu hn ed eryinecarresm. ental sales of yv ea ari ro su rsanc gat ie ng go fr rie osma 1t0medical devices for 5 varying rate over theper cent to 3 per cent.years. years ranging from 10Source: Department of Pharmaceuticals per cent to 3 per cent. 282 Economic Survey 2022-239.38 The government has undertaken various measures to improve the infrastructural facilitiesof the pharma sector. The concerned scheme, Strengthening the Pharmaceutical Industry (SPI),was launched on 11th March 2022 with a total financial outlay of ₹500 crore for five years fromFY22 to FY26 with multiple objectives. First, it aims to strengthen the existing infrastructurefacilities by providing financial assistance to pharma clusters to create common facilities.Second, it upgrades the production facilities of MSMEs to meet national and internationalregulatory standards by providing interest subvention or capital subsidy on their capital loans.Third, it also promotes knowledge and awareness about the pharmaceutical and medical devicesindustry by undertaking studies, building databases and bringing industry leaders, academia andpolicymakers together to share their knowledge and experience.India becomes the world’s 3rd largest automobile market9.39 The automobile sector is a key driver of India’s economic growth. In December 2022,India became the 3rd largest automobile market, surpassing Japan and Germany in terms of sales.In 2021, India was the largest manufacturer of two-wheeler and three-wheeler vehicles and theworld’s fourth-largest manufacturer of passenger cars. The sector’s importance is gauged by thefact that it contributes 7.1 per cent to the overall GDP and 49 per cent to the manufacturing GDPwhile generating direct and indirect employment of 3.7 crore at the end of 2021.Figure IX.22: Rising automobile Sales Figure IX.23: Moderation in automobileexports amid weakening global demand250200150100500FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23Apr-DechkaLTwo and three-wheelers 50Passeneger Vehicles403020100FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23Apr-DechkaLTwo and three-wheelers Passeneger VehiclesSource: Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM)9.40 The automotive industry is expected to play a critical role in the transition towards greenenergy. The domestic electric vehicles (EV) market is expected to grow at a compound annualgrowth rate (CAGR) of 49 per cent between 2022 and 2030 and is expected to hit one crore unitsannual sales by 2030. The EV industry will create 5 crore direct and indirect jobs by 20306. Tosupport and nurture this development, the government has undertaken multiple steps.6 https://www.investindia.gov.in/team-india-blogs/electric-vehicle-ev-sector-india-boost-both-economy-and-environment Industry: Steady Recovery 283Figure IX.24: Rising Sales of auto components6050403020100OEM Supply Aftermarket Exports Imports TurnovernoilliB$SUFY20 FY21 FY22Source: Ministry of Heavy IndustriesNote: OEM stands for Original Equipment ManufactureAftermarket means the market for spare parts, accessories, and components for motor vehicles.Figure IX.25: consumption enhancing Incentive Schemes1esahPEMAF• Tenure:2014-19• Budget allocation: ₹895 crore• Achievements• Supported 2.8 lakh Hybridand EV• Deployed 425 E-busesacross 10 cities• Sanctioned around 520 EVCharging station• Installed 479 EV chargingstation2esahPEMAFConsumption Enhancing IncentiveSchemes• Tenure: 2019-24• Budget Outlay: ₹10,000 crore• Envisaged to support 1 million2 Wheeler, 0.5 million 3Wheeler; 55,000 cars and 7090buses• Incentivised 7.1 lakh EVs• Sanctioned 7210 e-buses, 2172e-buses deployed until Dec2022• Sanctioned: 2,877 chargingstations in 68 cities and 1,576charging stations acrossexpressways/highwaysSource: Ministry of Heavy IndustriesNote: FAME stands for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles 284 Economic Survey 2022-23Figure IX.26: Production Linked Incentive SchemeslleCyrtsimehCdecnavdA• Tenure: FY23-FY27• Outlay: ₹18,000 crore• 3 applicants approved• Expected Investment:₹ 27,000 crore• Expected employmentgeneration: 2.7 lakh• Benefits:• Reduce prices of batteries• Will lead to faster EVadoption• Net savings of ₹2.0-2.5 lakhcrore on oil import bill overnext 5 yearstnenopmoc-otuAdnaotuAProduction Linked Incentive Schemes• Tenure: FY23-FY27• Outlay:₹26,000crore• 85applicants approved• Expected investment:₹ 67,690 crore• Expected employmentgeneration: 7.5 lakhSource: Ministry of Heavy Industries9.41 Despite the upbeat outlook, the automotive industry faces certain challenges. Higherborrowing costs and tempering global demand are expected to be near-term hurdles. Amongststructural issues, the increase in long-term third-party vehicle insurance premiums has increasedthe total upfront insurance cost by about 10-11 per cent, especially for two-wheelers. Therefore,the two-wheeler segment is the most affected and witnessed the lowest sales in the last ten years.Addressing these challenges will boost the automobile industry.India’s Prospects as a Key Player in the Global value chain9.42 The risk of supply chain shocks has never been more palpable than today, followingcompounding crises from the US-China trade war, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine.In this fast-evolving context, as global companies adapt their manufacturing and supply chainstrategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a global manufacturinghub this decade. The three primary assets to capitalise on this unique opportunity are thepotential for significant domestic demand, the Government’s drive to encourage manufacturing,and a distinct demographic edge, including a considerable proportion of the young workforce.The manufacturing sector in India is gradually shifting to more automated and process-drivenmanufacturing, which is expected to increase efficiency and boost the production of the industry.The ‘Make-in-India’ Initiative was launched in 2014 to make India a hub for manufacturing,design, and innovation. Since then, it has facilitated investment, fostered innovation and builtworld-class infrastructure. The progress made in infrastructure development is discussed inchapter 12 "Physical and Digital Infrasturcture: lifting potential growth".Make in India 2.0 and the PLI schemes9.43 To further enhance India’s integration in the global value chain, ‘Make in India 2.0’ is now Industry: Steady Recovery 285focusing on 27 sectors, which include 15 manufacturing sectors and 12 service sectors. Amongstthese, 24 sub-sectors have been chosen while keeping in mind the Indian industries’ strengths andcompetitive edge, the need for import substitution, the potential for export and increased employability.Efforts are on to boost the growth of the sub-sectors in a holistic and coordinated manner.Figure IX.27: 24 Sub-Sectors under Make in India 2.0Leather adFurniture Air-Conditioners Ready-to-EatFootwearFisheries Agri Produce Auto Components AluminiumElectronics Agrochemicals Steel TextileEV Components &Ethanol Ceramics Set-Top BoxesIntegrated CircuitsClose CircuitRobotics Televisions ToysCamerasDrones Medical Devices Sporting Goods Gym EquipmentsSource: DPIIT9.44 In pursuit of the objectives of the Make-in-India programme and with a vision to achieveAatmanirbharta, the government launched the PLI scheme. The scheme is expected to attract acapex of approximately ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years. It has the potential to generateemployment for over 60 lakh in India and increase the share of the manufacturing sector in totalcapital formation, which currently stands at around 17-20 per cent between FY12 and FY20.It is further believed that there will be a significant reduction in the trade deficit with domesticproduction substituting for imports. Sectors under which the PLI scheme has been announcedcurrently constitute around 40 per cent of the total imports. The scheme, spread across 14 sectors,can enhance India’s annual manufacturing capex by 15 to 20 per cent from FY23.9.45 PLI Scheme across these key specific sectors is poised to make Indian manufacturersglobally competitive, attract investment in the areas of core competency and cutting-edgetechnology; ensure efficiencies; create economies of scale; and make India an integral part ofthe global value chain. The scheme will benefit the MSME ecosystem in the country. The anchorunits built in every sector will require a new supplier base in the entire value chain. Most ofthese ancillary units will be built in the MSME sector.9.46 As of 31st December 2022, 717 applications have been approved under 14 Schemes.More than 100 MSMEs are among the PLI beneficiaries in sectors such as Bulk Drugs, MedicalDevices, Telecom, White Goods and Food Processing. As per recent reporting from implementingMinistries/ Departments, around ₹47,500 crore (US$ 6 billion) of actual investment has beenmade; production/ sales of ₹3.85 lakh crore (US$ 47 billion) of eligible products and employment 286 Economic Survey 2022-23generation of around 3 lakh has been reported and 106 per cent achievement of actual investmentreported versus the corresponding projections of FY227. Key sectors such as Large-ScaleElectronics Manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals, Telecom & Networking Products, Food Processingand White Goods have contributed considerably to investment, production, sales and employment.9.47 Some of the latest developments under the PLI programme include the launch of a design-led PLI in June 2022 to promote the entire value chain in telecom manufacturing and to build astrong ecosystem for 5G as part of the PLI Scheme for Telecom & Networking products. Approvalsunder this Scheme have already been granted to eligible companies. In September 2022, the Cabinetrecently approved PLI Scheme (Tranche II) on ‘National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar PVModules’, with an outlay of ₹19,500 crore to build an ecosystem for manufacturing of high-efficiencysolar PV modules in India, thus reducing import dependence in the area of renewable energy.Box IX.4: Shipbuilding Sector: achieving Self-Relianceand promoting Make in IndiaThe Shipbuilding industry is a strategically important industry due to its role in energy security, nationaldefence and the development of the heavy engineering industry. It has the potential to increase thecontribution of the industry and the services sector to the national GDP. With its immense direct andindirect linkages with most other leading industries, such as steel, aluminum, electrical machinery andequipment etc., and its huge dependence on infrastructure and services sectors of the economy, theshipbuilding industry has the potential to strengthen the mission of an ‘Aatmanirbhar’ Bharat. TheIndian Navy (IN) shipbuilding projects currently in progress at various Indian shipyards are poised toprovide the requisite impetus to the industry. With the objective to achieve strategic independence inshipbuilding and development of niche technology, as of date, more than 130 IN warships have beenconstructed at Indian shipyards, and presently, 41 of 43 ships and submarines are being constructedat various public and private sector Indian shipyards. These initiatives, through various channels, arecontributing to economic growth and employment in the country.Boost to ancillary IndustryShipbuilding with its links to other ancillary industries, including steel, engineering equipment,port infrastructure, trade and shipping services has the potential to create a collaborative productioneco-system. With the development of these ancillary industries, the sector generates opportunitiesfor smaller businesses and strengthens supply chain networks. It is noteworthy that a significantproportion of value addition, approximately 65 per cent, in the construction of a ship is derived frommanufacturers of shipboard materials, equipment, and systems.Significant Investment and employment Generation Multiplier effectsBased on International shipbuilding statistics, if one takes a conservative Marginal Consumption toGDP Ratio (MCGR) of 0.45 for the shipbuilding sector, the investment multiplier would be approx.around 1.82. For example, an injection of approx. ₹1.5 lakh crore in naval shipbuilding projectswould accrue a circulation of ₹2.73 lakh crore in the shipbuilding sector due to the multiplier effect.Among manufacturing activities, shipbuilding has one of the highest employment multipliersof 6.48. It is capable of generating mass employment in remote, coastal and rural areas, thereby7 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=18841818 https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1593424 Industry: Steady Recovery 287absorbing the labour migrating from agricultural pursuits to manufacturing facilities established byshipyards and their ancillary industries. The Indigenisation initiatives implemented by the IN haveresulted in a significant infusion of economic activity by creating employment opportunities for MSMEsand other industries. For instance, the recently commissioned INS Vikrant alone engaged approximately500 MSMEs, 12,000 employees from ancillary industries, and 2,000 shipyard employees.Further, a study undertaken by the IN for the construction of seven P17A ships reveals that aroundthree-fourths of the total project cost of warships is invested back into the Indian economy. Thisinvestment is ploughed back into the economy through indigenous sourcing of raw materials,development of equipment and systems installed onboard ships and other manpower services.Besides benefiting the ancillary industries and creating massive employment opportunities, anindigenous shipping and shipbuilding industry can also reduce freight bills and forex outgo, therebyreducing the current account deficit.Thus, we see that the strong forward and backward linkages of the shipbuilding sector play animportant part in the creation of a self-relient India.Fostering Innovation9.48 The government’s efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding,funding, industry-academia partnership and mentorship. The government has also strengthenedits IPR regime by modernising the IP office, reducing legal compliances and facilitating IPfiling for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries and others. This has resulted in a 46per cent growth in the domestic filing of patents over 2016-2021, signalling India’s transitiontowards a knowledge-based economy.9.49 These measures have begun to pay dividends. The Global Innovation Index (GII) ranksthe countries based on innovation performance, comprising around 80 indicators, includingmeasures on the political environment, education, infrastructure and knowledge creation of eacheconomy. As per the GII 2022 report, India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the firsttime in 2022 since the inception of the GII in 2007 by improving its rank from 81 in 2015 to 40in 2022. Further, India became the most innovative nation in the lower middle-income groupovertaking Vietnam (48th) and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.Box XI.5: ‘Flipping and Reverse Flipping: the recent developments in Start-ups’India ranks amongst the largest startup ecosystems in the world. An impressive 9 lakh+ direct jobshave been created by the DPIIT recognised startups (self-reported), with a notable 64 per cent increasein 2022 over the average number of new jobs created in the last three years. About 48 per cent of ourstartups are from Tier II & III cities, a testimony of our grassroots’ tremendous potential.Various targeted initiatives of the Government have given a major boost to start-ups. For instance,under the Start-up India Initiative, eligible companies get recognised as Start-ups by DPIIT to accessa host of tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) fast-tracking. As partof the umbrella schemes of the National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations(NIDHI) and atal Innovation Mission (aIM), entrepreneurship and innovation are fostered acrossthe start-up ecosystem in the country. The Fund of Funds for Start-ups (FFS) and Credit Guarantee 288 Economic Survey 2022-23Scheme for Start-ups (CGSS) support seed funding and successive credit needs. The R&Dplatform for technology sectors is offered by schemes such as MeitY Start-up Hub (MSH) andTechnology Incubation and Development of entrepreneurs (TIDe 2.0), among others.Engaging Indian start-ups with global peers is another essential pillar of Start-up India and isfacilitated through Government-to-Government partnerships, participation in international forums,and hosting of global events. Further, the Support for International Patent Protection in e&IT(SIP-eIT) Scheme encourages international patent filing by Indian MSMEs and start-ups9.Figure a: Jobs created by Start-ups26919816113288432017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022sdnasuohTTotal Number of Jobs Created (self-reported) by DPIITRecognised Start-upsNote: Data as on 17th January 2023While external support from the government has made it relatively easier than before forentrepreneurship to thrive, there are several inherent challenges faced by start-ups. Be it ever-elusivefunding, revenue generation struggles, lack of easy access to supportive infrastructure, or wadingthrough the regulatory environment and tax structures. It has also been observed that many Indiancompanies have been getting headquartered overseas, especially in destinations with favourable legalenvironments and taxation policies. The technical jargon for this may be identified as ‘Flipping’,which is the process of transferring the entire ownership of an Indian company to an overseas entity,accompanied by a transfer of all IP and all data hitherto owned by the Indian company. It effectivelytransforms an Indian company into a 100 per cent subsidiary of a foreign entity, with the founders andinvestors retaining the same ownership via the foreign entity, having swapped all shares.Typically, “Flipping” happens at the early stage of the Start-ups, driven by commercial, taxation andpersonal preferences of founders and investors. Some companies decide to “Flip” because the majormarket of their product is offshore. Sometimes, investor preferences like access to incubators drivethe companies to “Flip” as they insist on a particular domicile. Some companies prefer to domicile incountries where they would like to access Capital Market later for better valuations and ticket size.Better protection and enforcement of IP and tax treatment of Licensing revenue from IP, residentialstatus of Founders, and agile corporate structures have been the reasons for “Flipping” in the Past.In popular holding company jurisdictions like Singapore, dividends received from a Singaporeancompany/subsidiary are not taxed at the holding level. There are no withholding taxes when9 Source: PIB https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1884256, https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx-?PRID=1884069#:~:text=PLI%20Scheme%20extends%20an%20incentive,2020 Industry: Steady Recovery 289distributing dividends to residents or non-resident shareholders. This is a critical component since thedividend is one of the most popular repatriation tools. There are no withholding taxes in the UnitedArab Emirates (Uae) under current legislation. These jurisdictions have tailor-made their policiesand tax and incentive structures to incentivise companies to store IPs and create Holding companiesas Regional Headquarters. European jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands, provide for participationexemptions on dividends and capital gains (based on certain shareholding thresholds, i.e., 5 per centand other tests). These exemptions are currently unavailable in India, and any migration of existingstructures to India triggers capital gains tax. However, of late, with relatively easy access to Capitalthrough a vibrant Private Equity/Venture Capital Ecosystem, changes in rules regarding round-tripping, and the growing maturity of India’s capital markets have not only slowed down the Flipping,but companies are also exploring “Reverse Flipping”.Figure B: effect of Flipping on the structure of the companyPre-Flipping Post-FlippingTo accelerate ‘Reverse Flipping’, certain measures are possible, some of which are listed below:i. S implifying the process for grant of “Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) certification” for Start-upsii. Further simplification of taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs)iii. S implifying multiple layers of tax and uncertainty due to tax litigationiv. S implifying procedures for capital flows: Many countries, such as US and Singapore, have easiercorporate laws, with lesser restrictions on the inflow and outflow of capital and treatment ofHybrid Securitiesv. F acilitating improved collaboration and partnerships with established private entities to developbest practices and state-of-the-art start-up mentorship platformsvi. E xploring the incubation and funding landscape for start-ups in emerging fields like socialinnovation and impact investment.The flipping phenomenon mentioned above reflects start-ups venturing out for short-term gains in thedynamic, uncertain geopolitical world. However, the flip can be reversed with the collective action bythe Government related regulatory bodies and other stakeholders. With solution-oriented strategies,start-ups will continue to be the messengers of India’s entrepreneurial dynamism. 290 Economic Survey 2022-23Structural reforms have enhanced the Ease of Doing Business9.50 The ‘Make in India’ initiative has been striving to ensure that the business ecosystemin the nation is conducive for investors doing business in India and contributing to the growthand development of the Nation. This has been done through various reforms that have led toincreased investment inflows and economic growth. The reform measures include amendmentsto laws and liberalisation of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens, bringdown costs and enhance the ease of doing business in India. Burdensome compliances with rulesand regulations have been reduced through simplification, rationalisation, decriminalisation,and digitisation. Steps to promote manufacturing and investments include reduction in corporatetaxes, public procurement and Phased Manufacturing Programme.9.51 The DPIIT’s Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 (fifth edition), based onthe implementation of reforms by States/UTs, was released on 30th June 2022. It shows that7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs as part of the BRAP 2020 assessment,thereby significantly enhancing the Ease of Doing Business across the country. Reducing theCompliance Burden (RCB) on businesses and citizens is a continuous exercise to leapfrog tothe next level of governance excellence and improve Ease of Living. Ministries and States/UTshave reduced more than 39,000 compliances (as on 17th January 2023). Specifically, more than3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalised byMinistries and States/UTs based on details uploaded on DPIIT’s Regulatory Compliance Portalas on 17th January 2023. Further, the NSWS was soft-launched in September 2021 to improvethe ease of doing business by providing a single digital platform to investors for approvalsand clearances. The portal is rapidly gaining traction amongst the investor community and,as of 10th January 2023, has about 4.3 lakh plus unique visitors. 81,000+ approvals have beenfacilitated through NSWS, and 43,000+ approvals are currently under process. The portal willprogressively onboard more approvals and licenses based on user /industry feedback. This portalhas integrated multiple existing clearance systems of the various Ministries/Departments of theGovernment of India and State Governments to enhance investor experience.India and Industry 4.09.52 The advent of the fourth industrial revolution or industry 4.0 as it’s commonly referredto, has begun. The transformation integrates new technologies such as cloud computing,IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) into manufacturing processes, leadingto efficiencies across the value chain. While the adoption of these technologies in the Indianmanufacturing sector is underway, large-scale adoption is yet to happen. However, an enablingenvironment is rapidly developing. In recent years, India has made significant strides in internetpenetration which is one of the key requisites of industry 4.0. The push towards self-reliance insemiconductor technology and production will help India erect another pillar of this revolution– hyper-efficient processing technology.9.53 The government is cognisant of the importance of industry 4.0 in achieving the goalsof Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains. A fewinitiatives by the government include the SAMARTH (Smart Advanced Manufacturing andRapid Transformation Hubs) Udyog Bharat 4.0 under the Ministry of Heavy Industries andPublic Enterprises, which aims to encourage technological solutions to Indian manufacturing Industry: Steady Recovery 291units through awareness programmes and demonstrations. Another initiative is the establishmentof the Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution in India in 2018, which looks to develop policyframeworks for emerging technologies.conclusion and outlook9.54 Despite global headwinds, industrial production expanded during FY23, backed bysustained demand conditions. The growth in bank credit has kept pace with industrial growth,with a sequential surge evident since January 2022. Credit to MSMEs has seen a significantincrease in part, assisted by the introduction of the ECLGS. Amidst heightened global uncertainty,FDI in the manufacturing sector moderated in the first half of FY23. However, inflows stayedwell above the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving theease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world.9.55 On the positive side, easing input cost pressures owing to a fall in international commodityprices augurs well for company margins. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector has beenrising. It bodes well for new investment activity in creating additional capacity. Credit growthin the industry has also increased remarkably, suggesting that prospects for Capex investmentsby companies are brighter. The PLI schemes are set to unlock manufacturing capacity, boostexports, reduce import dependence and lead to job creation for both skilled and unskilled labour.On the downside, exports are slowing down and are likely to moderate along with the probableglobal economic slowdown. Volatile international commodity prices and supply disruptions inraw materials can weigh on industrial growth in the wake of new disruptions at the globallevel. The re-emergence of Covid-19 in China can trigger supply chain disruptions, as wasthe case during the pandemic period. On the other hand, if China returns to normalcy fromCovid-19, there can be an increase in commodity demand - thus reversing the recent declinein commodity prices. Of course, the strength and duration of the recovery in commodity priceswill be a function of many factors, such as the pace of China’s economic recovery and growthoutlook in North America and Europe. Notwithstanding such open questions, industrial outputin India should continue to grow steadily based on resilient domestic demand. 10ServiceS: Source ofCHAPTERStrengthIndia’s services sector witnessed a swift rebound in FY22 driven by growth in the contact-intensive services sub-sector, which bore the maximum burden of the pandemic. This sub-sector completely recovered from the pre-pandemic level in Q2 of FY23, driven by the releaseof pent-up demand, ease of mobility restriction, and near-universal vaccination coverage.Going forward, strong momentum growth and an uptick in the High-Frequency Indicators(HFIs) for the contact-intensive services sector reflect a strong growth opportunity in the nextfiscal. PMI services, indicative of service sector activity, has also witnessed a strong reboundin recent months with the retreating of the price pressures of inputs and raw materials.India has been a major player in services trade, being among the top ten services exportingcountries in 2021, having increased its share in world commercial services exports from 3 percent in 2015 to 4 per cent in 2021. India’s services exports have remained resilient during theCovid-19 pandemic and amid current geopolitical uncertainties, driven by higher demand fordigital support, cloud services, and infrastructure modernisation catering to new challenges.To ensure the liberalisation of investment in various industries, the Government has permitted100 per cent foreign participation in telecommunication services including all services andinfrastructure providers, through the Automatic Route. The FDI ceiling in insurance companieswas also raised from 49 to 74 per cent. Measures undertaken by the Government, such as thelaunch of the National Single-Window system and enhancement in the FDI ceiling through theautomatic route, have played a significant role in facilitating investment.With the waning of the pandemic and external shocks on account of the Russia-Ukraineconflict, there is evidence of improvement in the performance of various services sub-sectors.The hotel industry is thriving with improvements in occupancy rate, increase in the AverageRoom Rate (ARR) and rise in Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) which are now muchnearer to the pre-pandemic level of FY20. The tourism sector is also showing signs of revival,with foreign tourist arrivals in India in FY23 growing month-on-month with the resumptionof scheduled international flights and the easing of Covid-19 regulations. The Real Estatesector has witnessed resilient growth in the current year, with housing sales and the launchof new houses surpassing in Q2 of FY23 the pre-pandemic level of Q2 of FY20. InformationTechnology-Business Process Management (IT-BPM) and the E-commerce industry havebeen exceptionally resilient during the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by accelerated technologyadoption and digital transformation. The Government’s push to boost the digital economy,growing internet penetration, rise in smartphone adoption and increased adoption of digital Services: Source of Strength 293payments have also given a renewed push to these industries. The introduction and pilotingof Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will also provide a significant boost to digitalfinancial services. They may lay the framework for another generation of financial innovation.introduction10.1 The Covid-19 pandemic hurt most sectors of the economy, with the effect particularlyprofound for contact-intensive services sectors like tourism, retail trade, hotel, entertainment,and recreation. On the other hand, non-contact services such as information, communication,financial, professional, and business services remained resilient. However, the services sectorwitnessed a swift rebound in FY22, growing Year-on-Year (YoY) at 8.4 per cent compared to acontraction of 7.8 per cent in the previous financial year. The improvement was driven by growthin the ‘Trade, Hotel, Transport, Storage, Communication and Services related to broadcasting’sub-sector, which bore the maximum burden of the pandemic. The growth momentum hascontinued in FY23 as well. As per the First Advance Estimates, Gross Value Added (GVA) inthe services sector is estimated to grow at 9.1 per cent in FY23, driven by 13.7 per cent growthin contact-intensive services sector.

Services: Source of Strength 297Box X.1: initiatives in the insurance Sector by the insurance regulatoryand Development Authority of india (irDAi) in fY231The Indian Insurance sector is at an inflexion point. India will be one of the main drivers of globalinsurance industry growth over the next decade. Indian Insurance Market is the 10th largest in theworld and is poised to become the 6th largest by 2032, ahead of Germany, Canada, Italy, and SouthKorea2. The insurance regulator, IRDAI, has taken up the mission of universal insurance, which isexpected to lead to a significant increase in insurance penetration such that, when India celebrates 100years of its independence in 2047, every Indian has appropriate life, health, and property insurancecover and every enterprise is supported by appropriate insurance solutions. Towards this objective,the insurance regulator has taken various steps to promote healthy growth of the insurance industry,rationalise the regulatory framework, and reduce the compliance burden of regulated entities.In line with the Government of India’s vision towards Financial Inclusion and a strong emphasison accelerating reforms, IRDAI, during FY23, has implemented the following measures toincrease accessibility, innovation, competition, distribution efficiency, and choice availability whilemainstreaming technology and moving towards principle-based regime: -i. easy entry into the insurance sector: A Single Window NOC Portal (www.noc.irdai.gov.in) waslaunched to facilitate the incorporation of an insurer by making the NOC available in a hassle-freeand timely manner.ii. Quick launch of insurance Products: Insurers can now launch all Health & General Insuranceproducts, as well as the majority of Life Insurance products, without seeking prior approval fromIRDAI, thereby reducing the time taken to launch a new product in the market from a few monthsto a few days.iii. ease of doing business: IRDAI has taken several actions to lessen the burden of compliance. Inthis direction, so far, 70 returns have been rationalised, and about 85 circulars have been repealedwhile dispensing with the prior approval requirements in certain identified areas.iv. Providing further impetus to the industry: Given that the sector has reached a level of maturitythat may not necessitate closer supervision, more flexibility to the regulated entities in the areas ofoperational and business decisions is being considered.v. A ddressing dynamic needs of the industry: IRDAI has facilitated various measures as per theevolving needs of the sector, such as Tech-based add-ons (General insurers have been permittedto introduce tech-enabled concepts for Motor Insurance such as Pay as You Drive, Pay How YouDrive, etc.), expansion in the scope of the cashless facility in health insurance, Innovative productsin Fire Insurance, Ease of living for Senior Citizen.Major Services: Sub-Sector-Wise Performancetourism and hotel industry10.10 The post-pandemic scenario of global tourism is gradually converging to the pre-pandemicone. With travel restrictions and health concerns subsiding, tourism has become a vital driver ofa strong upswing in contact-intensive activity. As per the World Tourism Barometer of the UnitedNations World Tourism Organisation (November 2022), international tourism showed robustperformance in January-September 2022, with international tourist arrivals reaching 63 per centof the pre-pandemic level in the first nine months of 2022, boosted by strong pent-up demand,improved confidence levels and the lifting of restrictions. The pace of recovery would have beeneven stronger but for the lingering global uncertainties and higher inflation in advanced nations.1Until October 20222Sigma Report (No 4/2022) by Swiss Re (Page no 15) 298 Economic Survey 2022-2310.11 The Covid-19 pandemic affected the fortunes of the hospitality and tourism industries inrecent years. The hotel industry closed the year 2020 with an average hotel occupancy rate of 33-36 per cent, reflecting a decline of 32 per cent3. In the wake of falling demand and occupancies,hotels reduced tariffs significantly to attract business, thus, pulling down Revenue per AvailableRoom (RevPAR) to a dismal low of ₹1,500 - ₹1,800, a decline of around 57-59 per cent. However,hotel occupancy began a strong recovery in the third quarter of 20214, driven by domestic leisuretravel growth, partial resumption of business travel in the country, as well as wedding and socialevents. Small-to-medium-sized domestic MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conference, Exhibitions)events also made a comeback, fuelling demand for hotels. The sector ended the year with anaverage occupancy of 42-45 per cent, up 10-13 percentage points over the previous year.10.12 The reintroduction of travel restrictions across States at the beginning of 2022 due to theemergence of a new Covid-19 strain, Omicron, again threw the Indian hospitality sector into anupheaval. Other leisure and business travel plans were put on hold, barring critical and urgenttravel as people exercised caution. The low demand resulted in an average hotel occupancy rateof 50 per cent during January-March 2022. However, due to the lower severity and hospitalisationrate of the Omicron variant, travel demand in India began its return to normalcy in March 2022.Aiding the revival of travel demand was the high vaccination rate in the country, as also effectivepandemic management that ensured speed in imposing as well as the lifting of mobility restrictionsclosely tracking the spread and subsiding of the virus. After a two-year hiatus, India also resumedall regular international flights at full capacity as 2021-22 came to a close. Consequently, theentire aircraft movement (cargo aircraft + passenger aircraft) in the country increased by 52.9 percent YoY between April and November 2022, reaching 93.9 per cent of the movement recordedbetween April and November 2019. Presently, the hotel industry is thriving with improvements inoccupancy rate, an increase in Average Room Rate (ARR) and a rise in RevPAR5. The occupancyrate in November 2022 stood at around 68-70 per cent, completely recovering the average pre-pandemic level of 2019-20.10.13 Tourism industry was another sector that was adversely impacted by the pandemic. Asignificant decline in Foreign Tourist Arrivals in India was witnessed in FY21. As per a study6conducted by the Ministry of Tourism in collaboration with the National Council of Applied andEconomic Research (NCAER), Tourism Direct Gross Value Added (TDGVA) witnessed a declineof 42.8 per cent in Q1, 15.5 per cent in Q2, and 1.1 per cent in Q3 of FY21 due to the overalleconomic slowdown in FY21. Tourism being a contact-intensive sector, employment in the sectorwas impacted due to the lockdown, and it was a global phenomenon. 14.5 million direct jobsin Q1, 5.2 million in Q2, and 1.8 million in Q3 are expected to have been lost compared to anestimated 34.8 million direct jobs in the tourism sector in the pre-pandemic period of FY20.10.14 However, with the waning of the pandemic, India’s tourism sector is also showing signsof revival. Foreign tourist arrivals in India in FY23 have been growing month-on-month withthe resumption of scheduled international flights and the easing of Covid-19 regulations.

The scheme was applicable until 31st March 2022 or until 5lakh free visas were issued, whichever is earlier. The benefit was available only once per tourist.real estate10.17 The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic accentuated a slowdown in every economic space,and the real estate sector was no different. Project delays, deferment of big-ticket purchases,stagnation of property prices, and scarce funding for developers induced slackening of demand.The situation was further aggravated by the associated lockdown and migration of workforces Services: Source of Strength 301involved in the sector to their natives. The work-from-home model had an impact on the demandfor office space requirements by the corporates.10.18 The Pandemic, however, brought about a change in individual home buyers’ sentimentin favour of owning a house. With the easing of curbs, there was an increase in interest in theresidential housing sector and more so in the readily available and affordable segment. Thehybrid work mode with the privileges of working from anywhere encouraged first-time homebuyers to move away from the conventional metros, and this brought about a pent-up demandin the residential real estate markets of Tier II and III cities. Improvement in affordability inresponse to measures taken by the government during the pandemic, such as lower interest rates,reduction in circle rates, and cut in stamp duties on transaction of sale/purchase of immovableproperty, the extension of the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) also played a significant rolein post-pandemic rebound of Real Estate sector.Box X.3: Measures taken by the government to boost the housing sectorThe various policy intervention by the government, including ‘Housing for All’, AatmanirbharBharat, etc., provided an impetus to the Housing Finance sector. The permission by RBI tolending institutions to grant a total moratorium of 6 (3+3) months in case of payment failure duebetween 1st March 2020 to 31st August 2020, infusion of ₹75,000 crore for Non-Banking FinancialCorporations (NBFCs), Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) and Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs),among others, have also contributed to the revival of the real estate sector.The interest subvention under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Credit Linked Subsidy SchemeUrban) (PMAY-CLSS (U)) has been the demand-side driver in the residential housing space.This, along with streamlined policies to increase the credit flow, has helped in the creation of aconsumer-friendly ecosystem for housing finance. Since its inception, the government has releaseda subsidy amounting to ₹ 53,548 crore benefitting approximately 22.87 lakh households. Further,the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) created sufficient liquidity in the sector for viable growth.Under the Affordable Housing Fund, National Housing Bank has disbursed ₹ 34,588 crore for3.9 lakh dwelling units since its inception. Under the Special Liquidity Facility of RBI, NationalHousing Bank (NHB) disbursed ₹13,917 crore and ₹8,112 crore during the 1st and 2nd wavesof the pandemic, respectively, to ensure seamless business as usual in the sector. Including theabove, National Housing bank has provided Liquidity support of ₹ 88,400 crore through variousrefinance schemes since the onset of the Pandemic.The concessional liquidity provided the sector with the much-needed liquidity influx for keeping thesector resilient. The Co-lending model has been put forward with the aim to leverage the liquiditybase of the banks and reach of HFCs to deliver formal housing credit to the bottom of the pyramid.The Smart City Project, with a plan to build 100 smart cities across India, was aimed at improving theoverall opportunity for the real estate sector and encouraging investments. The overall affordability inthe residential real estate sector was high during the post-pandemic period, as reflected by a decline inthe weighted average annual interest rate on home loans from 8.6 per cent during January-March 2020to 7.3 per cent during January-March 2022 for Scheduled Commercial Banks. Also, with a consistentthrust on affordable housing and a series of measures taken by the Government and the Regulators, thesector bounced back, registering a more robust growth with consistent improvement in sales as well asnew launches. 302 Economic Survey 2022-2310.19 The geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine have again raised concernsregarding disruption in the global supply chain and its consequent impact on the real estatesector. With a volatile international market, the surge in prices of construction materials haspushed developers to halt ongoing construction. The Wholesale Price Index for Cement, Lime &Plaster has increased from 127.1 in December 2021 to 137.6 during December 2022, indicatingan uptick in the input cost for construction. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has further affectedthe supply chain resulting in price escalations of steel, cement, finishing materials, importedchemicals, and fuel, thereby increasing the overall construction cost and resulting in a rise inhousing prices.10.20 Notwithstanding the current impediments, such as rising interest rates on home loans andan increase in property prices, the sector has witnessed resilient growth in the current year, withhousing sales and the launch of new houses in Q2 of FY23 surpassing the pre-pandemic level ofQ2 of FY20. There is evidence of a significant decline in the inventory overhang9 dipping to 33months during Q3 of FY23 from 42 months last year. The unsold inventory stood at 8.5 lakh atthe end of 2022 with 80 per cent of the stocks under various stages of construction. This comeson the back of sustained sales momentum as the sector steadily recovers from the impact of thepandemic.

Lockdownsand mobility restrictions disrupted consumer behaviour and gave an impetus to online shopping.The Government’s push to boost the digital economy, growing internet penetration, rise insmartphone adoption, innovation in mobile technologies, and increased adoption of digitalpayments further accelerated the adoption and growth of e-commerce. According to the GlobalPayments Report by Worldpay FIS, India’s e-commerce market is projected to post impressivegains and grow at 18 per cent annually through 2025.10.27 The expansion of e-commerce to newer segments like grocery, fresh-to-home fruits andvegetables, and general merchandise has contributed to the expansion of the customer base beyondtraditional buyers. And as per the latest report ‘How India Shops Online 2022’ by Bain & Company,emerging categories – fashion, grocery, general merchandise – would shore up e-commerce growthin India and would capture nearly two-thirds of the Indian e-commerce market by 2027.10.28 There has also been an increase in the adoption of digital solutions by Micro, Small andMedium Enterprises (MSMEs) like e-commerce and e-procurement, realising the prospects ofincreased revenues and margins, improved market reach, access to new markets, and customeracquisition. A recent study by IIFT analysing the impact of the interaction between MSMEsand e-commerce found that in recent years, MSMEs that adopted digital solutions fared farbetter than offline MSMEs, assisting them in accessing a large marketplace without incurringhuge costs. The E-commerce platform has not only empowered small businesses by removinggeographical barriers and providing a large customer base but also allowed them to deal directly 306 Economic Survey 2022-23with manufacturers and suppliers, thus reducing the cost of procurement. This increased accessto suppliers significantly helps small business owners scale up their businesses at a much lowerinvestment level, thus boosting their cost structure.10.29 Further, there has been a phenomenal geographical expansion with the growth ofe-commerce business in rural India driven by increased smartphone penetration, internetadoption, and increased purchasing power of rural customers. In addition, fiscal supportduring the pandemic helped boost e-commerce penetration in rural areas, likely by increasingconsumption, which could mostly be done online in the presence of pandemic restrictions.

With a strong foundation provided by the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity,UPI, and other regulatory frameworks, the pandemic has aided acceleration in digital adoptionand provided a fillip to digital financial services solutions by banks, NBFCs, insurers as well asfintech. The pandemic provided the opportunity for fintech companies to reach the underservedand provide cost-effective financial services to those at the bottom of the pyramid. Whileglobally, the technological solutions cushioned the reverberations of the pandemic, India tookthe lead with the fintech adoption rate of 87 per cent, substantially higher than the world averageof 64 per cent as per the latest Global FinTech Adoption Index15.10.35 Over the last few years, the number of neobanking platforms and global investmentsin the neo-banking segment has also risen consistently.

The growth of these institutions is spurredby the need for on-demand and easier-to-access financial solutions by a young and increasinglydigitally savvy demographic. Neobanks have eased availability and provided access to financialservices to MSMEs and underbanked customers and areas. The government also, through various15 https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/banking-and-capital-markets/ey-global-fintech-adoption-index.pdf 308 Economic Survey 2022-23initiatives, has given a push to digital banking solutions. 75 Digital Banking Units (DBU) across75 districts announced in Union Budget 2022-23 to take banking solutions to every nook andcorner of the country have been launched.10.36 The introduction of CBDC will also significantly boost digital financial services. Issuanceof CBDC in India offers several benefits, which inter alia, include reduction in operationalcosts involved in physical cash management, fostering financial inclusion, bringing resilience,efficiency, and innovation in the payments system, boosting innovation in cross-border paymentsspace, and providing public with uses that any private virtual currencies can provide, withoutthe associated risks. As of July 2022, there are 105 countries in the process of exploring CBDC,a number that covers 95 per cent of the global GDP. Many countries have already launched theCBDC, while others are in the pilot stage.10.37 RBI has also recently launched pilots of CBDC in both the Wholesale and Retail segments.Digital Rupee –Wholesale- the pilot in the wholesale segment was launched on 1st November2022, with the use case being limited to the settlement of secondary market transactions ingovernment securities.

This was done at the behest of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India and withthe support of the Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance.The core principle of the NeSL-DDE platform is to digitise all the steps of the document/agreement execution journey. These include: -• Submission of information and document/agreement to be executed on the platform• Flexibility to accommodate any agreement/document format• Consent-based process• Digital payment of stamp duty and affixing of digital e-stamp certificate• Verification of the identity of the executants and digital execution using an electronicsignature• Secure storage transmission and retrieval of the digitally executed document generatedusing the platformThe NeSL-DDE platform eliminates the need for the physical presence of the executants andthe manual process to be carried out for executing documents/agreements. By doing so, theplatform generates several benefits, such as lower execution time and cost, a secure system,authorised access, bulk processing, fraud prevention, legal robustness, and evidentiary value.A significant enabler in the journey of digitisation of documents/agreements in the financialsector is the use of the Aadhaar e-Sign, which has made electronic signatures widely availableto citizens at a nominal cost.The NeSL-DDE platform has garnered the support of state governments, ministries, andfinancial institutions. DFS has been encouraging banks to consider adopting DDE for theiragreements. Currently, 23 States and Union Territories are available for digital e-stampingon the NeSL DDE platform. 27 banks and NBFCs are using the platform for executing theiragreements, and so far, more than 9 lakh transactions have been undertaken. This includessmall-ticket consumer lending transactions to large-value corporate lending transactions. 310 Economic Survey 2022-23One use case of the NeSL-DDE platform is the electronic bank guarantee (e-BG), which takesaway all the issues and challenges associated with the issuance, transfer, and management ofphysical bank guarantees and brings inefficiencies of time and cost savings. As the adoption ofe-BG picks up, the NeSL platform can also function as a central repository of bank guarantees.Recently, the Department of Expenditure has amended the General Financial Rules, 2017, topermit the acceptance of e-BG in the government procurement process.While the initial use case of NeSL-DDE is financial documents/agreements, the platformshall also enable the digital execution of other documents/agreements. This secure, paperless,hassle-free contracting offered by NeSL-DDE will have significant implications on the easeof doing business in the nation.outlook10.39 India’s services sector growth which was highly volatile and fragile during the last2 fiscal years, has shown resilience in FY23 driven by the release of pent-up demand, easeof mobility restriction, near-universal vaccination coverage and pre-emptive governmentinterventions. Broad-based recovery has been observed in recent months, with pick up in almostall sub-sectors especially contact intensive services sector, which bore the maximum brunt ofthe pandemic. This is reflective of an uptick in the performance of various HFIs, reflecting asolid upswing in recent months, hinting at an enhanced presentation of the services sector inthe next fiscal. The prospects look bright with improved performance of various sub-sectorslike Tourism, Hotel, Real estate, IT-BPM, E-commerce etc. The downside risk, however, lies inthe external exogenous factors and bleak economic outlook in Advanced Economies impactinggrowth prospects of the services sector through trade and other linkages. 11ExtErnal SEctor:CHAPTERwatchful and hopEfulIndia’s external sector has been buffeted by shocks and uncertainty manifested in terms ofelevated, though now easing global commodity prices; tightening international financialconditions; heightening financial market volatility; reversal of capital flows; currencydepreciation, and looming global growth and trade slowdown. However, it has been ableto face these headwinds from a position of strength on the back of strong macroeconomicfundamentals and buffers.During FY23 (till December 2022) India’s exports have displayed resilience on the backof record levels of exports in FY22. Petroleum products, gems & jewellery, organic &inorganic chemicals, drugs & pharmaceuticals were among the leading export items.However, the slowdown in Indian exports is inevitable in a slowing global economycharacterised by slowing global trade. Recognising the key role exports play in improvingthe resilience of the external sector, from a medium to long-term perspective, variousexport promotion measures are being considered/implemented. These measures wouldnurture the inherent comparative advantage that Indian exports embody. In addition,while National Logistics Policy would ease the domestic frictions to encourage Indianexports by reducing the cost of internal logistics, the latest Free Trade Agreements, suchas with UAE and Australia, would address the external frictions by creating opportunitiesfor exports at concessional tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Thus, the whole ecosystemwould evolve in an export-friendly manner over time.Apart from the elevated crude oil prices, the revival of economic activity contributedto an increase in imports. Petroleum, crude & products; electronic goods; coal, coke& briquettes, etc.; machinery, electrical & non-electrical and gold were among the topimport items. While the continued softening of the global commodity price outlook wouldassist moderate imports going forward, non-gold, non-oil imports may not deceleratesignificantly. Further, efforts are underway to promote international trade settlementin Indian Rupees. Once these initiatives gain traction, dependence on foreign currencywould potentially reduce, making the economy less vulnerable to external shocks.Balance of Payments (BoP) encountered pressures during the year under review. Whilethe impact of a sharp rise in oil prices was discernible in the widening of the CurrentAccount Deficit (CAD), notwithstanding the cushion provided by the surplus on Invisibles(services, transfer, and income), policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve and thestrengthening of the US dollar led to Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) outflows. As aresult, the surplus of the capital account was lower than the CAD leading to a depletionof forex reserves on a BoP basis. However, going forward, the expected easing of crude oil 312 Economic Survey 2022-23prices, the resilience of net services exports and buoyant inward remittances would resultin lower CAD during the remainder of FY23 and is expected to be within sustainablelimits.The fortified shock absorbers of India’s external sector are in place to cushion the globalheadwinds be it the formidable forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, ormarket-determined exchange rate. While forex reserves as of the end December 2022stood at US$ 562.72 billion, accounting for 9.3 months of imports, the ratio of externaldebt to GDP is at a comfortable level of 19.2 per cent as of end-September 2022.Introduction11.1 Two global shocks in the new millennium – one an economic shock and the other, a healthshock - have had very contrasting repercussions on the global economy. Following the globalfinancial crisis in 2007-08 as the inflationary pressures were muted, interest rates were extremelylow for long years. The easing financial conditions supported global economic growth, whichreached 4.5 per cent in 2010. Now, the Covid-19 pandemic is another shock to global growthperformance, with economic growth down to a negative of 3.8 per cent in 2020. The followingtwo years saw inflation rates rise to multi-decade highs, fuelled by global commodity and foodprice spikes. The situation has been further amplified by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. To stemthe situation, monetary authorities in advanced economies, especially the US Federal Reserve(US Fed), are accelerating the pace of monetary policy normalisation. The 10-year Treasuryyield in the US increased almost six-fold between mid-2020 and mid-2022. Risk assets weresold off sharply triggering capital flight from many emerging and frontier market economies,bringing to a halt the rebound of net capital flows to developing countries observed since the lastquarter of 2020.11.2 Interest rates and prices of risk assets have been extremely volatile since April 2022,reflecting heightened uncertainty about the economic and policy outlook, exacerbated by lowliquidity. The US dollar appreciated sharply against currencies of Emerging Market Economies(EMEs) and major advanced economies facing high borrowing costs. Thus, global financialconditions have considerably tightened especially since April 2022, and the balance of risks issignificantly skewed to the downside, thereby weakening the global economic outlook. Globalgrowth is forecast to slow from 6.0 per cent in 2021 to 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.7 per cent in2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).1 This is the weakest growth profilesince 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the pandemic. Further,external public debt vulnerability concerns are being exacerbated as such debt in developingeconomies is at record levels presently and most of it is owed to private creditors, with muchof it involving variable interest rates that could spike suddenly.2 Thus, emerging markets face ahost of risks emanating from elevated external borrowing costs, sticky high inflation, volatilecommodity markets, uncertain global economic growth outlook, and spill overs from policytightening in advanced economies.1World Economic Outlook Report, IMF, October 2022.2“South Asia’s Current Macroeconomic Challenges and Policy Priorities”, Keynote Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor, Reserve Bankof India –6 January 2023 - at the high-level Conference co-organised by IMF Asia and Pacific Department and IMF South Asia RegionalTraining and Technical Assistance Centre, New Delhi External Sector: Watchful and Hopeful 31311.3 Against this fast-evolving global backdrop, this chapter chronicles the developments in theexternal sector of the Indian economy focusing on exports, imports, international investment,foreign exchange reserves, movement of the currency against the US dollar, external debt, andthe BoP situation. Where available, a comparison of some of these indicators with some peercountries is also made to present India’s external sector situation in a proper perspective.trade helping India reap the Benefits of Globalised world11.4 In the present globalised and integrated world, trade is essential for developing countriesto reap the benefit of increased globalisation of products and financial markets. It is wellrecognised that trade is not an end in itself but a means to balanced, equitable, and sustainabledevelopment. Conventional economic theories point towards potential gains that could emergefrom openness to international trade and investment.11.5 Over time, the trade openness of countries across the globe has been increasing as measuredby trade as a proportion of GDP. For the world as a whole, the share of trade as a percentage ofworld GDP3 has been in the range of 50-60 per cent since 2003 and stood at 52 per cent in 2020,according to the World Bank database. For India as well, the share of trade as a percentage ofGDP has been steadily increasing, being above 40 per cent since 2005 (except 2020 being thepandemic year). The ratio stands at 46 per cent in 2021 and 50 per cent for H1 of 2022.Global Scenario11.6 Post Covid-19-induced disruptions, global trade prospects have improved in FY22. Globaltrade exhibited resilience in the first half (H1) of 2022, notwithstanding the headwinds from theRussia-Ukraine conflict. Robust merchandise imports – emerging primarily from Europe, theUnited States, and parts of the developing world supported the growth of merchandise trade inH12022. This partially reflected pent-up demand relating to the legacy of the pandemic-drivenspending shift from services towards goods that were constrained earlier because of the supplybottlenecks. Other factors contributing to the trend were the appreciation of the dollar in the caseof the United States, the relative dynamism of intra-regional trade in Europe, and favourableterms-of-trade effects in some large emerging economies due to elevated energy prices.4 Theglobal trade volume grew by 4.8 per cent in H12022, on top of an impressive recovery of 9.7per cent in 2021, as per the World Trade Organisation (WTO) statistics. The global merchandisetrade in value terms rose year-on-year (YoY), by 22.2 per cent in 2021, reversing the decelerationobserved in the previous three years. During the H1 of 2022, the trade-in value terms grew by 32per cent compared to the corresponding period of 2019.511.7 However, the global trade outlook turned grimmer in the second half (H2) of 2022 on theback of a confluence of adverse factors including the increasing likelihood of a recession in themajor economies and the tapering demand for consumer durables; aggressive monetary policytightening by several central banks; disorderly financial conditions; continued supply-chaindisruptions and elevated freight charges. The leading indicators of global trade viz., inventories3Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of GDP.4UNCTAD, Trade and Development Report 2022, Development prospects in a fractured world: Global disorder and regional responses, October2022.5WTO’s press release, International Trade Statistics, 5 October 2022. 314 Economic Survey 2022-23and new export orders seem to bear testimony to these adverse events. Trade growth is likelyto slow in the closing months of 2022 and into 2023, according to the WTO Goods TradeBarometer6 released on 28 November 2022, as the global economy continues to be buffeted bystrong headwinds. The current reading of 96.2 is below both the baseline value for the index andthe previous reading of 100.0, reflecting the slowdown in demand for traded goods.11.8 Thus, as regards the future trade projections, according to the WTO, world trade is expectedto lose momentum in H2-2022 and remain subdued in 2023. The organisation forecasts globaltrade to grow in 2023 by just 1 per cent, a sharp downward revision from the previous estimateof 3.4 per cent7. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the forecast dueto shifting monetary policy in advanced economies and the unpredictable nature of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), inits Global Trade update of December 2022 has also noted that the ongoing trade slowdownis expected to worsen for 2023 and further that while the outlook for global trade remainsuncertain, negative factors appear to outweigh positive trends. 0.5 3.43.51.002018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023-5-5.6-10)Y-o-Y(egnahctnecrepemuloV/noillirt$SUeulaVValue (US$ trillion) Volume Volume Forecast (Oct 2022) Volume Forecast (April 2022)Source: WTOIndia’s growing and diversifying trade11.9 International trade has been an important pillar of the resilience of India’s external sector.Trade as a percentage of GDP for India was in the range of 12-15 per cent in the 1980s; 16-25per cent in the 1990s and 25-50 per cent in the 2000s.

India’s pharmaexports grew despite Covid impacted disruptions in supply chain increasing significantly fromUS$ 15.4 billion in FY15 to US$ 24.6 billion in FY22 and stood at US$ 18.8 billion during April-December 2022, registering a positive growth of 3.6 per cent over April- December 2021. Thehigh growth in export was on account of the stocking of inventories of medicines by countriesall over the world, and increased demand for vaccines and medicines related to the Covid-19pandemic which India was in a position to provide. India has also been seeing consistent growthin exports of electronic goods. Electronic goods exports which remained below US$ 10 billiontill FY19, have shown an increase of 51.6 per cent from US$ 11.0 billion during April-December External Sector: Watchful and Hopeful 3172021 to US$ 16.7 billion during April-December. 2022. Engineering goods exports crossedthe US$ 100 billion mark in FY22 for the first time. Organic and inorganic chemicals exportshave increased significantly in FY22 and were USD 23.0 billion during April-December 2022registering a growth of 6.5 per cent over the same period last year.11.12 As the pandemic ebbed, India witnessed a revival in domestic demand resulting in strongimport growth. Merchandise imports for the period April-December 2022 were US$ 551.7billion as against US$ 441.5 billion during the period April-December 2021. Among majorimport commodities, petroleum crude & products imports increased by 45.6 per cent to US$163.9 billion in April-December 2022 compared to US$ 112.6 billion in April-December 2021and continue to be the highest imported commodity.11.13 Energy demand may be pushing India’s imports for fuel including coal and Petroleum, Oil& Lubricants (POL), whose share rose to 37.1 per cent in total imports in April-December 2022against 30.4 per cent in the corresponding period last year. Other principal imports includedelectronic goods; coal, coke & briquettes; machinery electrical & non-electrical, and organic &inorganic chemicals (Tables 6.2 A&B of Statistical Appendix).

The Netherlands has displaced China from the 3rd spot as India's exportingpartner. India has diversified its export destinations over time. For example, the share of SouthAfrica in total exports has risen from 1.2 per cent in FY19 to 2.0 per cent in FY23 (April toNovember). Over the same period, the share of Brazil has increased from 1.2 per cent to 2.5 percent and that of Saudi Arabia from 1.7 per cent to 2.3 per cent. As regards imports, China, UAE,USA, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have a joint share of 40 per cent of the total imports of India.However, the share of China declined to 13.8 per cent during April-November 2022 from 15.5per cent a year ago. Similarly, the share of the USA declined to 6.9 per cent in April-November2022 from 7.2 per cent a year ago (Refer to Table 6.4 in Statistical Appendix).Trade in Services11.16 India maintained its dominance in the world services trade in FY22. Despite pandemic-induced global restrictions and weak tourism revenues, India’s services exports stood at US$254.5 billion in FY22 recording a growth of 23.5 per cent over FY21 and registered a growthof 32.7 per cent in April-September 2022 over the same period of FY22. Software and businessservices together constitute more than 60 per cent of India’s total services exports and exhibitedstrong growth during Q2FY23. While strong revenues in major information technology (IT)companies from various segments such as retail and consumer business; communications andmedia; healthcare; and banking, financial and insurance services drove the growth in softwareexports, a significant pick-up in engineering, and research and development related servicesboosted the growth in business services exports during the quarter.11.17 Services imports rose by 25.1 per cent between FY22 and FY21 to reach US$ 147.0 billionand have registered growth of 36.7 per cent in April-September 2022 over the same period ofFY22. The increase in services imports is mainly on account of payments for transport services,travel and other business services. Following the resumption of global activity, shortages of External Sector: Watchful and Hopeful 319shipping vessels and high transportation costs resulted in a spike in transport payments. Travelimports saw a growth following the easing up of travel restrictions.table xI.2: resilient performance of Service trade (Values in uSd Billion)2020-21 2021-22 apr-Sept 2022 (p)Exports Imports Exports Imports Exports Importstotal Services 206.1 117.5 254.5 147.0 156.1 90.6Manufacturing services on physical0.3 0.03 0.5 0.1 0.6 0.1inputs owned by othersMaintenance and repair services n.i.e. 0.2 0.8 0.2 1.4 0.1 1.0Transport 21.9 19.8 32.7 35.8 19.4 23.1Travel 8.5 11.5 9.1 16.3 10.5 13.8Construction 2.6 2.6 2.6 2.9 1.6 1.6Insurance and pension services 2.4 2.1 3.3 2.1 1.7 1.1Financial services 4.3 4.8 5.5 5.6 3.8 3.1Charges for the use of intellectual1.3 7.7 0.8 9.0 0.7 4.5property n.i.e.Telecommunications, computer, and103.1 12.3 125.6 14.5 72.6 8.6information servicesOther business services 49.2 49.5 58.9 51.7 36.9 28.3Personal, cultural, and recreational2.3 2.8 3.2 4.5 1.9 2.9servicesGovernment goods and services n.i.e. 0.6 1.0 0.8 0.9 0.4 0.4Others n.i.e. 9.5 2.6 11.3 2.2 6.1 2.2Source: RBI, BoP statement P: provisional 086443084453908070605040 3020100Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q32020-21 2021-22 2022-23 (P)noillib$SUServices Export Services Import Net of ServicesSource: Department of Commerce, RBI ; P: provisional 320 Economic Survey 2022-2311.18 While merchandise exports are witnessing some slowdown in the second half of 2022,India's service exports have been robust. Since India offers low-cost knowledge-based services,the demand for them has not fallen even amid a global economic slowdown and a negativeoutlook for the near future. The estimated value of services export for April-December 2022is US$ 235.8 billion as against a value of US$ 184.7 billion in April- December 2021. Theestimated value of services imports for April- December 2022 is US$ 135.0 billion compared toUS$ 105.5 billion in the corresponding period last year. Supported by the services sector, India'soverall exports (Merchandise and Services combined) in April-December 2022 are estimatedto be US$ 568.6 billion, exhibiting a positive growth of 16.1 per cent over the same period lastyear. Overall imports in April-December 2022 are estimated to be US$ 686.7 billion, displayinga positive growth of 25.6 per cent over the same period last year.foreign trade policy11.19 India’s Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) has, conventionally, been formulated for five yearsat a time. The focus of the FTP has been to provide a framework of rules and procedures forexports and imports and a set of incentives for promoting exports. The latest FTP for 2015-2020 is in vogue at present. To provide policy stability during the pandemic period, the five-year FTP 2015-20 was extended from 2020 to 2022. The policy has been further extended tillMarch 2023 on account of volatile global economic and geopolitical situations and currencyfluctuations. During this period, the Government has been taking significant measures andconsistently looking into opportunities to diversify the exports both in terms of products as wellas potential markets. The Government is actively working on facilitating trade agreements andlaunching schemes in consultation with various stakeholders. In the year 2022, India signedFree Trade Agreements (FTAs) with UAE and with Australia. This aims to provide greatermarket access with a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services and makethe exporters competitive. The Export Preparedness Index8 has also been introduced to evaluateStates’ potentials and capacities. It will guide all stakeholders towards strengthening the exportecosystem at both the national and sub-national levels.International trade Settlement in Indian rupees11.20 In July 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular permitting an additionalarrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in Indian Rupees (INR)to promote the growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India and to supportthe increasing interest in the global trading community in INR as an international currency.The framework involves invoicing of exports and imports in INR, market-determined exchangerates between the currencies of the trading partner countries, and settlement through specialRupee Vostro9 accounts opened with authorised dealer banks in India.11.21 Under this arrangement for settlement, (a) Indian importers undertaking imports through8NITI Aayog in partnership with the Institute of Competitiveness has prepared an Export Preparedness Index to identify challenges and oppor-tunities; enhance the effectiveness of government policies; and encourage a facilitative regulatory framework. The structure of the EPI includes4 pillars –Policy; Business Ecosystem; Export Ecosystem; Export Performance – and 11 sub-pillars –Export Promotion Policy; InstitutionalFramework; Business Environment; Infrastructure; Transport Connectivity; Access to Finance; Export Infrastructure; Trade Support; R&DInfrastructure; Export Diversification; and Growth Orientation.9A Vostro account is an account that a domestic bank holds for a foreign bank in the domestic bank’s currency, i.e., Rupee. Such accounts enabledomestic banks to provide international banking services to their clients who have global banking needs. External Sector: Watchful and Hopeful 321this mechanism shall make payment in INR which shall be credited into the Special Vostroaccount of the correspondent bank of the partner country, against the invoices for the supplyof goods or services from the overseas seller /supplier, while (b) Indian exporters, undertakingexports of goods and services through this mechanism, shall be paid the export proceeds in INRfrom the balances in the designated Special Vostro account of the correspondent bank of thepartner country.11.22 The above-mentioned framework for international settlement in INR acquires significanceagainst the backdrop of the US Fed aggressively hiking the policy rates and its hawkish stand,the consequent rallying of the US dollar to multi-decade high levels, and concomitant weakeningof currencies of various EMEs including the INR. The framework could largely reduce the netdemand for foreign exchange, the US dollar in particular, for the settlement of current account-related trade flows. Further, the use of INR in cross-border trade is expected to mitigate currencyrisk for Indian businesses. Protection from currency volatility not only reduces the cost of doingbusiness but also enables better business growth, improving the chances for Indian businessesto grow globally. It also reduces the need for holding foreign exchange reserves and dependenceon foreign currency, making Indian economy less vulnerable to external shocks.10 Further, itcould assist Indian exporters in getting advance payments in INR from overseas clients and inthe longer term promote INR as an international currency once the rupee settlement mechanismgains traction. One of the prerequisites for the emergence of an international currency is that thesaid currency needs to be increasingly used for trade invoicing. In terms of foreign exchangemarket turnover (daily averages), as per the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022, the USdollar is the dominant vehicle currency accounting for 88 per cent of the global forex turnover.The INR accounted for 1.6 per cent. If the INR turnover rises to equal the share of non-US, non-Euro currencies in global forex turnover of 4 per cent, INR could be regarded as an internationalcurrency, reflecting India’s position in the global economy.11Initiatives to enhance trade11.23 The commendable performance of India’s exports, standing at US$ 422.0 billion in FY22,exceeding the target of US$ 400 billion, has been the culmination of efforts from all quartersand across stakeholders. Some of the factors leading to the achievement of this target wereputting in place of targets by the Government, including the setting of specific targets - country-wise, product-wise, and Export Promotion Council-wise; monitoring of the targets and coursecorrection where required. The export growth was driven by an increase in demand for productslike petroleum, cotton yarn, textiles, chemicals, and engineering goods. India was able to leveragethe gap in the supply of certain products in the wake of the pandemic-related disruptions andmeet the global demand. Exports were also helped by favourable global commodity prices. Someof the specific schemes of the Government which have and are facilitating and encouragingexports are as follows.11.24 focus on agricultural products: India’s agricultural exports achieved the highest everexport in FY22 reaching US$ 37.8 billion and it continued to perform well in FY23 with exports10Keynote address delivered by Shri T Rabi Sankar, Deputy Governor, RBI at the Annual Day event of the Foreign Exchange Dealers Associa-tion of India (FEDAI) on 20 October 2022 in Mumbai.11Patra, M. D (2022): India@75, RBI Bulletin, August, pp 13-34. 322 Economic Survey 2022-23of US$ 26.8 billion during April- November 2022 backed by an effective agriculture export policy.Pro-active support of export promotion agencies including Export Inspection Council, PlantationBoards, and Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA),and export facilitating measures like online issuance of certificates required for exports, aidedgrowth of agricultural exports. Regular promotions were organised for agricultural productsthrough participation in trade fairs and special events in association with the Indian Missions.To initiate agriculture exports from UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, APEDA has linkedKashmir valley start-ups, new entrepreneurs, Farmer Producer Organisations/farmer groups,and exporters of the region with importers. Regular shipments of high-value Kashmir Saffron(GI) are taking place to destinations including the Middle East, EU, and North America.11.25 Interest Equalisation Scheme: This Scheme was formulated to give benefit in theinterest rates being charged by the banks to the exporters on their pre- and post-shipment rupeeexport credits. While extending the scheme, from 1 October 2021 onwards, subvention rateshave also been reduced. Henceforth, reduced revised rates of 3 per cent (erstwhile 5 per cent)subvention to MSME manufacturing exporters and 2 per cent (erstwhile 3 per cent) applies tomerchant and other manufacturer exporters exporting along 410 (erstwhile 416) HS lines.11.26 remission of duties and taxes on Exported products (rodtEp) scheme: The schemeseeks remission of Central, State and Local duties/taxes/levies at different stages at the Central,State, and local level, which are incurred in the process of manufacturing and distribution ofexported products, but are currently not being refunded under any other duty remission scheme.11.27 Export credit Guarantee: The Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) supportsIndian exporters and banks by providing export credit insurance services. ECGC provides insurancecover on the export consignment to protect exporters from the consequences of the payment risks. Italso provides Export Credit Insurance to Banks (ECIB) to protect the Banks from losses on accountof export credit given to exporters due to the risks of insolvency and/or protracted default of theexporter borrower. The ECGC has launched a new scheme in July 2022, under its ECIB products.Under this scheme the insurance cover to banks providing pre-shipment and post-shipment financehas been enhanced to 90 per cent from an average coverage of 70 per cent for accounts with an exportworking capital limit of up to X20 crore to support small exporters.11.28 Krishi udan Scheme: Krishi Udan Scheme was launched in August 2020 on internationaland national routes to assist farmers in transporting agricultural products so that it improvestheir value realisation. Krishi Udan 2.0 was launched in October 2021 enhancing the existingprovisions, mainly focusing on transporting perishable food products from the hilly areas, North-Eastern states, and tribal areas. For facilitating and incentivising the movement of agriculturalproduce by air transportation, the Airports Authority of India provides a full waiver of Landing,Parking charges, Terminal Navigational Landing Charges and Route Navigation Facility Chargesfor Indian freighters and Passenger-to-Cargo Aircraft primarily around 25 airports focusing onNorth Eastern, Hilly and Tribal region and 28 airports in other regions/areas. Further, five moreairports have been included under the Scheme, making it 58 airports.11.29 trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme: The Government has been implementingthe Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme since FY18 to assist Central and State Government External Sector: Watchful and Hopeful 323Agencies in the creation of appropriate infrastructure for the growth of exports from theStates. The Scheme provides financial assistance in the form of grant-in-aid to Central/StateGovernment owned agencies for setting up or for up-gradation of export infrastructure as perthe guidelines of the Scheme.11.30 districts as Export hubs – One District One Product Initiative: The Districts as ExportHubs-ODOP initiative is aimed at targeting export promotion, manufacturing, and employmentgeneration at the grassroots level, making the States and Districts meaningful stakeholders andactive participants in making India an export powerhouse thereby contributing to the AatmNirbharmission and achieving the vision of Make in India for the world and being Vocal for Local. Theinitiative is also aimed at fostering balanced regional development across all districts of thecountry. It seeks to select, brand, and promote products/services from each district of the countryfor enabling holistic socioeconomic growth across all regions, attract investment in the districtto boost manufacturing and exports. A growing emphasis on exports by focusing on districts aspotential export hubs is also likely to integrate India more closely with the global value chainand propel India to be a significant exporter by leveraging the diversity and competitiveness inagriculture, marine, textile, pharmaceutical, chemicals and many engineering products.India’s Global trade Engagements11.31 This era of globalisation has been accompanied by a proliferation of trade agreementsand the emergence of competing trade blocs. These trends are affecting every business, everyindustry, and every country so that keeping up with these changes has become a challengingtask for policymakers around the globe. Governments have been pursuing international tradecooperation largely driven by diverse external and internal political economy considerationssuch as promoting peace and stability, increasing market size and most importantly, insuringthemselves against unfavourable trade policies of other countries.11.32 India has always stood for an open, equitable, predictable, non-discriminatory, and rule-based international trading system. India considers Regional Trading Arrangements (RTAs) as‘building blocks’ towards the overall objective of trade liberalisation and as complementing themultilateral trading system. Recognising that RTAs would continue to feature permanently in worldtrade, India has engaged with its trading partners/blocs with the intention of expanding its exportmarket since the early part of the previous decade and began concluding, in principle agreementsto move, in some cases, towards Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements (CECA)which covers FTA in goods, services, investment and identifies areas of economic cooperation.11.33 The economic rationale for FTAs was the diversification and expansion of India’s exports to itstrading partners, providing a level playing field vis-à-vis the competing countries having preferentialaccess in our trading partners, as well as gain easier access to raw materials and intermediateproducts, at lower costs, for stimulating value-added domestic manufacturing. In the case of theIndia-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), India-Korea, and India-Japan Agreements,this was also part of a geopolitical strategy that dovetailed well into India’s “Look East Policy.”11.34 India has so far concluded 13 FTAs and 6 Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). Themost recent in the list are the India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement(CEPA) which was signed on 18 February 2022 and officially entered into force on 1 May 324 Economic Survey 2022-232022 and the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA),which was signed on 2 April 2022 and entered into force on 29 December 2022. Further, Indiais presently engaged in FTA negotiations with some of its trading partners, notable amongthese FTAs are – (i) India-UK FTA, (ii) India-Canada CEPA/ Early Progress Trade Agreement(EPTA), (iii) India-EU FTA. Moreover, India has also initiated action to review some of theexisting FTAs, namely, India-Singapore CECA, India-South Korea CEPA, and India-ASEANTrade in Goods Agreement and initiated discussions on scoping for the CECA with Australia,as envisaged under Ind-Aus ECTA.12 Box XI.1 discusses the rise in the number of FTAs beingentered into worldwide and various factors that determine their usefulness to a trading partner.Box xI.1: free trade agreementsFTAs or RTAs in terms of the WTO rules13, are economic instruments available to a country forleveraging its competencies in trade and investment. As of June 2016, all WTO members now haveat least one RTA in force. There has been a substantial rise in the number of trade agreements with355 notifications of RTAs having been made to the WTO (As of 1 December 2022– Source: WTOwebsite). Many WTO members continue to be involved in negotiations to create new RTAs, whichare mostly bilateral. However, a recent development has been negotiations and new agreementsamong more than two WTO members, such as:• Pacific Alliance between Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru (Signed on 10 February 2014;entered into force on 1 May 2016);• Tripartite Agreement, linking parties to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, theEast African Community and the Southern African Development Community (Launched on 10June 2015 and entered into force at different dates by different members);• Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (Signed on 8 March 2018;entered into force on 31 October 2018);• African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) (Signed on 21 March 2018 and entered into forceat different dates by different members); and• Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP) between the ASEAN members and sixother WTO members (Signed on 15 November 2020; entered into force on 1 January 2022).The limited progress in the multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO is one of the reasonsresponsible for the increase in FTAs. FTAs are viewed favourably by trading countries in comparisonto multilateral negotiation at the WTO forum as they are easy to negotiate and provide flexibility tofactor in geopolitical considerations.The purpose of RTAs is to lower tariffs on goods and services and increase cooperation betweentrading partners with the aim of increasing trade, lower prices for consumers, and provide enhancedexport opportunities for producers. RTAs can also have a larger impact on the economy. For instance,Bailé et al. (2019) found that FTAs are positively correlated with direct domestic value-added exports,as well as forward and backward participation in global value chains.12 For an understanding of various types of trade agreements that India has entered into, may refer to: https://www.tpci.in/research_report/types-of-trade-agreements/.13RTAs, as per WTO rules, are any reciprocal trade agreement between two or more partners, not necessarily belonging to the same region. External Sector: Watchful and Hopeful 325According to the conventional gravity model, developed by Tinbergen (1962), bilateral tradebetween two nations is proportional to their respective sizes, measured by their GDPs and inverselyproportional to the geographic distance, a proxy for transportation cost. Over time, more variables,such as exchange rates, income levels and shifting demand patterns, have been added to the standardgravity model to test their relevance in influencing trade (Osabuohien et al., 2019).While an FTA provides the enabling environment for enhancing trade by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers (NTBs), the trade growth of a country depends on many factors, such as:(a) Specific features of the FTA such as the extent of tariff relaxations given vis-à-vis the MostFavoured Nation (MFN) tariffs14, on which products they are given and how the relaxation isstaggered, i.e., is it over a long time or short time that the relaxations are agreed to be rolled out.15(b) The extent of concessions in terms of Rules of Origin (RoO)16 and removal/easing of NTBs.While tariff barriers are agreed to be reduced in an FTA, NTBs, such as sanitary and phytosanitarymeasures, technical barriers to trade, contingent trade-protective measures etc., may lower theutilisation of the FTAs by traders.(c) The capacity of an economy to increase the supply of products/services for which the FTAhas provided an enhanced export venue. This ‘supply-response’ is determined by a wide rangeof factors which largely fall outside the ambit of an FTA. They include various policies onproduction aspects, a country’s physical and institutional infrastructure, and other elementsdetermining the short-term flexibility of an economy. In other words, the supply-response isgoverned by the potential for trade creation wherein a member of an FTA, having a comparativeadvantage in producing a product, is now able to sell it to its FTA partners because trade barriershave been removed (Viner, 1950).(d) The effect of the FTA would also depend on income growth in the importing markets and theprice competitiveness of exports of a partner country in a trade agreement so as to be able totake advantage of the agreement.Further, not all trade may happen through the FTA route, especially if the RoO are cumbersome orgoods are already trading at MFN zero duty. In order to take advantage of the FTAs, these must beaggressively utilised by the traders and service providers. Thus, it may not happen that there will bea sudden or significant increase in trade after an FTA is signed between two or more countries. Thetrade balance would shift only gradually and may also turn out to not be in favour of each partner,depending on a host of factors, some of which are listed above.rEfErEncES• Baier, S.L., Y.V. Yotov, and T. Zylkin. 2019. “On the Widely Differing Effects of Free TradeAgreements: Lessons from Twenty Years of Trade Integration,” Journal of InternationalEconomics 116:206–226.14 The MFN clause refers to a special trading status given by one country to another that gets applied to all the other members of the WTO.15 FTAs generally have phase-in periods in which existing trade barriers are phased out over time. This is generally done so that producers in theimporting country can adjust to import competition. This typically occurs over 10 to 15 years after the ratification of the FTA.16Rules of origin are the criteria needed to determine the national source of a product. Their importance is derived from the fact that duties andrestrictions in several cases depend upon the source of imports. 326 Economic Survey 2022-23• Osabuohien, E. S., Efobi, U. R., Odebiyi, J.

India’s current accountbalance (CAB) recorded a deficit of US$ 36.4 billion (4.4 per cent of GDP) in Q2FY23 incontrast to a deficit of US$ 9.7 billion (1.3 per cent of GDP) during the corresponding periodof the previous year. The widening of the current account deficit (CAD) in the second quarterof FY23 was mainly on account of a higher merchandise trade deficit of US$ 83.5 billion andan increase in net investment income outgo. For the period April- September 2022 (H1FY23),India recorded a CAD of 3.3 per cent of GDP on the back of an increase in the merchandisetrade deficit, as compared with 0.2 per cent in H1FY22. However, a comparison with theposition of the CAB for selected countries shows that India’s CAD is modest and withinmanageable limits.xI.7: current account Balance (caB): Magnitude and composition30 620410200-10-2-20-4-30-40 -6Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q22020-21 2021-22 2022-23(P)noilliB$SUPDGfotnecrePCAB CAB to GDP ratio (RHS)806040200-20-40-60-80-100Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q22020-21 2021-22 2022-23 (P)noilliB$SUa. current account balance and as b. composition of currenta per cent of Gdp account balanceNet Merch.

As a result,as the net financial inflows fell short of the CAD, there was a depletion of foreign exchangereserves on a BoP basis to the tune of US$ 25.8 billion in H1FY23 in contrast to an accretion ofUS$ 63.1 billion in H1FY22. But huge valuation losses (US$ 48.9 billion) contributed to thenet depletion of US$ 74.6 billion of reserves in nominal terms during the period.11.43 India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 532.7 billion as of end-September 2022,covering 8.8 months of imports. The reserves augmented to US$ 562.7 billion as of end-December 2022 covering 9.3 months of imports. As of end-November 2022, India was the sixthlargest foreign exchange reserves holder in the world according to data compiled by the IMF.As seen from the graph, the import coverage of foreign currency reserves has declined since thepre-pandemic levels in most emerging market economies; however, that of India has increasedfrom 95% in Q4 2019 to 96.5% in Q3 2022.

Are theresome international benchmarks or thumb rules which can serve as a guide? What are the factorswhich a country should consider while determining its own threshold of “adequacy”? How best toensure the liquidity of such reserves as against mere availability? This box attempts to answer thesequestions by drawing from the relevant literature and present an academic perspective.FER is required for various purposes, such as to maintain the exchange rate within a certain range,or to maintain a certain level of exchange rate if the country follows a fixed exchange rate system;maintain liquidity and allow time to absorb shocks in situations where access to borrowing is curtailedor very costly. The optimal level of reserves empowers the government to maximise the welfare ofthe representative consumer, given the constraint of sudden stops in terms of debt rollover crisis. Thedrivers behind the accumulation of reserves have evolved over the years: initially for precautionarypurposes until the early 2000s, followed by goals of monetary and exchange rate policies (ArslanYavuz, et al 2019). Accordingly, the FERs of several countries have witnessed a rising trend, more sosince the global financial crisis of 2008.table: total foreign exchange reserves excluding gold (in uS$ bn)%change:nov-2005 2008 2019 2020 2021 2021 over20222008Russian Federation 175.9 411.8 443.9 457.0 497.6 567.3 20.8India 131.9 247.4 432.4 549.1 594.4 555.3 140.3Brazil 53.3 192.8 353.6 351.5 354.6 331.5 83.9United States 54.1 66.6 118.4 133.9 240.2 237.8 260.7United Kingdom 54.0 56.1 158.4 161.2 176.0 204.1 213.7Indonesia 33.1 49.6 125.3 131.1 140.3 134.0 182.9South Africa 18.6 30.6 48.9 47.4 50.3 60.0 64.4Australia 41.9 30.7 55.6 39.2 53.8 57.9 75.2World 4395.0 7418.2 12195.3 13122.5 13944.7 11598.6* 88.0Source: International Financial Statistics, IMF*Figure as of Sept 2022This brings in the debate on adequacy of reserves. Conventionally, there are three measures ofadequacy of reserves, viz. ratios of reserves to imports, to monetary aggregates, and measures ofexternal debt (IMF, 2000). According to the traditional approach to determining the adequacy ofreserves, the simple rule of thumb is three months of imports or full cover of short-term debt. Asregards the former, there is little empirical support for whether the adequate coverage should be threemonths, as opposed to say two or six (IMF, 2011). The latter derives from the Guidotti–Greenspan-IMF rule which states that a country's reserves should equal short-term external debt (one-year orless maturity), suggesting a ratio of reserves-to-short term debt of one. The rationale is that countries 332 Economic Survey 2022-23should have enough reserves to cope with the withdrawal of short-term foreign capital. Then thereare also money-based indicators of reserves which provide a measure of the potential for resident-based capital flight from the currency. The indicators used are the ratio of reserves to broad money orthe ratio of reserves to base money which help in assessing reserve adequacy under fixed exchangerate regimes. Each of these indicators may, in themselves, not be adequate to assess the requirementsof FERs for an economy and different measures may typically be used for different purposes.The IMF (SM/00/65, 3/23/2000), noted the importance of short-term debt as a source of risk but cautionedagainst excessive reliance on a single indicator and pointed to the need to consider various potentialsources of short-term demand for reserves. Further, IMF (SM/01/311, 10/16/2001) has noted the needto complement indicator-based analyses with stress-testing of the BoP. In addition, there are customisedrisk-based broader-based metrics tailor-made to capture sources of risk emanating from external liabilities(debt and equity) as well as current account variables (export earnings) and some measure of potentialcapital flight (broad money) (IMF, 2011). Adequacy should be considered against total resources availableto meet shocks, a broader concept than the BoP-determined definition of reserve assets.While reserves are imperative in both preventing crises situations and mitigating their impact, thereis a cost involved in holding them and they are subject to diminishing returns. The costs borne by aneconomy for holding FER include the opportunity cost, in terms of the difference between domesticand foreign borrowing rates and loss due to the value reduction in the denominated FER. Rodrik(2006) examines the social cost of FERs and finds that the income loss to most developing countriesamounts to close to one per cent of GDP.Fukuda and Kon (2010) evaluate the macroeconomic impact of reserve accumulation and find evidencethat an increase in FERs raises external debt outstanding but shortens debt maturity. Further, in the long-run, consumption declines, and exports, are promoted by encouraging a switch from the non-tradablesector to the tradable sector through higher investment and growth. Further, FERs could be inflationarythrough exchange rate effects (Lin, et al 2009) and moral hazard and incentive effects (Chitu, 2016).Therefore, an economy should organise its reserves FER, in terms of the optimal size and currencycomposition, considering the benefits, costs, and impacts of holding them. Co-movement of thedomestic currency with key currencies and the currency invoicing of trade (Ito, 2019); trade flows(trade invoicing), financial flows (share of debt service payments in a currency), and currency pegs(Eichengreen, 2000) are the dominant factors influencing the currency composition of FERs. Further,drawing from the field of finance, the Value at Risk (VaR) approach has also been employed to arriveat the optimal foreign exchange portfolio (Hung et al. (2008).As briefly reviewed above, the rich literature on reserve adequacy presents very useful backgroundinformation and empirical analysis for policy choices and likely outcomes.rEfErEncES• Arslan, Yavuz and Cantú, Carlos (2019), “The size of foreign exchange reserves”, BIS PapersNo 104.• Chiou, J-S., Hung, J-C, and Hseu, M-M.

On a financial yearbasis, i.e., from April to December 2022, the INR has depreciated against US$ by 8.3 per cent.20 Overthe same period, the US dollar has appreciated by 4.4 per cent in terms of the US dollar index.21 Thisholds even on a calendar year basis, i.e., from January to December 2022, the INR has depreciatedby 10.8 per cent whereas the US dollar has appreciated by 6.4 per cent. The Nominal EffectiveExchange Rate (NEER) of the US dollar (27 economies) appreciated by 7.8 per cent in the calendaryear 2022, up to December, while the NEER of India (64 economies) depreciated by 4.8 per cent.In other words, it is not that the INR has weakened, but it is the US dollar that has strengthened. Nomatter how many tweets are written against that observation, it is a fact. Several other currenciesdepreciated even more value against the US dollar than the INR (Refer Figure I.12 of Chapter I).Thus, the external value of INR vis-à-vis the US dollar has seen very orderly movements during theyear since the onset of the current geopolitical crisis.11.45 Further, the INR appreciated against select major currencies barring the US dollar. Theaverage exchange rate of INR against the Pound Sterling appreciated by 6.7 per cent in April-December 2022 over April - December 2021. This rate of appreciation was 14.5 per cent withrespect to the Japanese Yen and 6.4 per cent against the Euro.20 Change in Monthly average exchange rate in December 2022 over April 2022.21The U.S. dollar index (US$X) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies.

The difference between an economy’s external financial assetsand liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.23 The Net IIP positiondetermines whether a country is a net creditor or debtor nation by measuring the difference inits external assets and liabilities. These statistics serve as an indicator of a country’s financialcondition and soundness. The Net IIP, along with the BoP transactions, reflects the domesticeconomy’s set of international accounts.11.49 For India, as of end-September 2022, Indian residents’ overseas financial assets at US$847.5 billion were lower by US$ 73.0 billion or 7.9 per cent compared to the level as of end-March 2022, mainly due to the reduction in reserve assets even as trade credit and overseasdirect investment recorded an increase. Reserve assets at US$ 532.7 billion, accounting foraround 62.9 per cent of India’s international financial assets fell by 12.3 per cent over the sameperiod.11.50 International liabilities at US$ 1,237.1 billion as of end-September 2022 were lower byUS$ 41.6 billion (3.2 per cent) as compared to the level as of end-March 2022. This fall wasattributed primarily to direct investment (net) outflows, while variations in the exchange rate ofthe rupee vis-a-vis other currencies also had an impact on the change in liabilities when valuedin US$ terms. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 50 per cent as of end-September 2022.11.51 Thus, the net claims of non-residents on India, valued at US$ 389.6 billion as of end-September 2022, increased by US$ 31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022.

However, external debtas a ratio to GDP fell to 19.2 per cent as of end-September 2022 from 20.3 per cent a year ago.The literature documents that the optimal threshold for India’s external debt is around 23-24per cent of GDP.24 Thus, India has the potential growth positive space as far as the external debtlevel is concerned. While testifying to the prudent management of India’s external debt, thiscontrasts with the external debt distress unfolding in many peer countries, post-covid.11.53 The long-term debt was lower at US$ 478.7 billion as of end-September 2022 thanUS$ 498.1 billion a year ago with the share of long-term debt falling to 78.4 per cent from82.8 per cent during the same period. On the other hand, the short-term debt at US$ 131.7billion as of end-September 2022 was higher than US$ 104.8 billion as of end-September2021. Accordingly, the share of short-term debt in total debt went up to 21.6 per cent from17.4 per cent. In this context, it needs to be noted that about 97 per cent of short-termdebt is in the form of trade credit to finance imports and hence the rise in short-term debtis stability-friendly. Further, while a major part of India’s external debt is denominatedin the US dollar (55.5 per cent as at-September 2002), the Indian rupee-denominatedcomponent (30.2 per cent) occupies the second largest position, insulating the externaldebt from foreign currency risk, thereby augmenting stability friendly characteristics ofthe external debt.11.54 As of end-September 2022, Sovereign External Debt (SED) amounted to US$ 124.5billion, decreasing by 5.7 per cent over the level a year ago. Non-SED, estimated at US$ 486.0billion as of end-September 2022, posted a growth of 3.2 per cent over the level a year ago.Deposit-taking Corporations (except the Central Bank) and non-financial corporations accountedfor the bulk of non-SED.11.55 The Ministry of Finance’s “India’s External Debt: A Status Report 2019-20”, providesdetails of the evolution of India’s external debt.25 A discernible trend in the rise in external debtof the non-sovereign sector over the SED is seen since FY99. Accordingly, typically, in a normalyear, it is the relative movements in non-SED that influences the dynamics of the country’sexternal debt. In the pandemic year of FY21, it was the growth in SED that accounted for a largershare of the overall growth of foreign debt due to Covid-19 loans from multilateral institutions.As the pandemic receded and normalcy was restored with the revival of the economy, the usualdynamics of India’s external debt returned as the growth in non-SED constituted as much as4.7 percentage points out of the overall external debt growth of 8.0 per cent at end-March2022. However, the quarter ending September 2022, yet again witnessed deviation from theusual dynamics. It was the relative growth in SED (akin to the pandemic year) that influencedthe overall external debt dynamics on the back decline in external assistance as well as othergovernment debt which includes FPI investment in G-Sec and SDR. Out of the overall declinein India’s external debt by 0.4 per cent, the fall in the SED was 0.5 per cent, while the rise innon-SED was 0.2 per cent.24 Gopinath, Tulasi and Rajeshwar.

The empiricalliterature documents that global growth exerts a strong statistically and economically significantimpact on India’s real exports, though the impact has reduced over the years.26 As noted earlier(para 11.2), global growth is forecast to slow down in 2022 and 2023 as per IMF estimates.This is the weakest growth profile since 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acutephase of the Covid-19 pandemic.11.59 Thus, the export outlook may remain flat in the coming year if global growth does notpick up in 2023, as indicated by many forecasts. In such cases, product basket and destinationdiversification which India is taking through FTAs would be useful to enhance trade opportunities.At times when the base (global growth and global trade) is not growing, export growth willhave to come predominantly through market share gains. In turn, that comes from the focus onefficiency, productivity, technology, and innovation. That game has to be lifted. Governmentscan try and open markets through FTAs. But, to take advantage of that is in the hands of privatesector participants.11.60 India is facing competition from South Asian countries in a few of its export competitiveproducts. In the textile sector, Bangladesh and Vietnam are seen to be expanding their exportsglobally, in recent years. Further, Vietnam has been able to expand its exports in machinery andequipment; computers, electronic products, certain agriculture products etc. However, giventhe benefits of the lower average age of the working population along with the advantage ofeconomies of scale, India has the potential to cater to the global demand for several products ina cost-effective manner.11.61 On the imports side, notwithstanding uncertainty surrounding the outlook on globalcrude oil prices, the recent softening in its prices augurs well for India’s POL imports. However,non-oil, non-gold imports, which are growth-sensitive, may not witness a significant slowdownas Indian growth continues to be resilient.11.62 While recognising the potential adverse developments, it is important to take cognisanceof innate buffers to India’s external sector. India’s export of services, primarily contributed bysoftware, business, and travel services, while remaining robust during the year so far, embodiesa greater degree of resilience. India is cementing its position as the top remittance receiver in theworld, with inward remittances projected to be at record levels during 2022. Accordingly, a largesurplus under services and remittances would cushion the widening trade deficit. Consolidatingan increasing share of non-debt flows in financing CAD over the years, net FDI flows remainedrobust during the current year, while the net FPI inflows turned positive in recent months. Thus, theCAD would be within manageable limits and eminently financeable. Above all, the forex reservesremained comfortable at US$ 562.7 billion as of end-December 2022, covering 9.3 months ofimports. The stock of India’s external debt has been prudently managed.26Chinoy, S. Z and Jain, T (2018): What Drives India’s Exports and What Explains the Recent Slowdown? New Evidence and PolicyImplications; NCAER, Policy Forum; https://www.ncaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/a4.pdf 340 Economic Survey 2022-2311.63 From a cross-country perspective too, India’s external sector has fared relativelybetter and hence positioned relatively stronger to face the evolving adverse global scenario asevidenced by the Indian rupee outperforming most EME currencies, comfortable import coverand moderate CAD. India’s external debt vulnerability indicators are benign by internationalstandards. To sum up, while India’s external sector faces challenges, it is performing relativelybetter as compared to many of its peers as it has inbuilt shock absorbers to weather them. 12Physical and digitalinfrastructure: liftingCHAPTERPotential growthThe invention of the wheel set in motion the necessity of travelable paths, and since thenthe saga of infrastructure has expanded from canals to modern capital structures such asrailways, roads etc. depending on the necessities of the region. In the last 75 years in Indiasince Independence, infrastructure development has moved on a consistent growth curvebuilding the assets required by the nation across sectors such as transportation, housing,commercial development, telecom and most recently, sanitation. As a key enabler of socio-economic enhancement of a region, the government has used ‘social overhead capital’to push development in the remotest areas of the country through dedicated budgetaryallocation, cross-subsidising revenue-generating infrastructure and focussed programmedelivery. This has helped in expanding physical transportation and connectivity, providingservices at point-of-use and deepening digital penetration.Infrastructure, being a melange of numerous sectors, its multiplier effects in the economycannot be realised if it operates in silos. Thus, in 2019, Government of India adopteda forward-looking programmatic approach towards infrastructure. The NationalInfrastructure Pipeline was born with a projected investment of around ₹111 lakh crorefor FY20-25 for developing a comprehensive view of infrastructure development inthe country, monitoring its progress at the highest levels in the government for timelycompletion, and enabling a pipeline view for investors for them to plan infrastructureinvestments. The funding for infrastructure comes from a variety of sources, fromgovernment to private sector to multilateral. However, given the quantum of fundinginvolved, a creative financing option such as asset monetisation was also envisagedthrough the 5 lakh crore National Monetisation Pipeline. Apart from generating criticalfinancial resources, private participation in running risk-free brownfield assets will alsohelp in ushering in operational efficiencies and better management of public assets.The programmatic approach to infrastructure is complemented by structural andfinancial reforms such as infrastructure financing options of InvITs and REITs, creation ofDedicated Financing Institution (NaBFID), recapitalisation of other sectoral DFIs, pushto PPP ecosystem through Model Concession Agreements by line ministries and enablingsocial infrastructure development through the revamped Viability Gap Funding scheme.To bring in further convergence with comprehensive planning across centre and states,PM GatiShakti has sectoral complementarity of logistics facilitation through the NationalLogistics Policy launched in Sept 2022. All of this is expected to tighten the nuts and boltsfor the arduous infrastructure journey that our country has undertaken together by the 342 Economic Survey 2022-23participation of centre, state, local governments and the private sector.This story has seen many successes. While roads, railways, and waterways haveseen unprecedented expansion in the last eight years, ports and airports have beensubstantially upgraded. This has also helped the country move from unimodal to multi-modal transportation, providing a window of opportunity to the private sector to investand reinvest in these assets, which has already been facilitated by the policy of assetmonetisation. Extending infrastructural facilities is only part of the story; modernisationis the other important principle that has been attempted with verve and achieved withcommendable speed.In keeping with the winds of change around the globe, we have placed a great emphasison digital and communications development, but, have taken the principle to new heightsin terms of usability, interoperability and accessibility. The country has come a long wayfrom a time when a basic telephone connection was viewed as a luxury, to a stage wheremost individuals now have a mobile connection. It is not a hyperbole to state that withthe thrust on Digital India, the story of digital infrastructure and services in India willalways be seen by the world with a certain regard and appreciation. In a very short time,the country has seen a great multiplier effect on social and economic growth throughthe different uses of digital enablement led by the humble mobile phone and the Aadharnumber– targeted beneficiary identification for various benefits, provision of healthcareand education services and financial inclusion. Close on this, arrived the success storyof India’s sui-generis payment infrastructure (UPI), which travelled internationally withselect adoption and global acclaim. The bouquet of digital public infrastructure productslike e-rupi,e-way bill, TReDS for MSMEs etc have ensured real value for money toconsumers while reducing the compliance burden for producers. And now, with the visionof $1 trillion digital economy by 2025, the government is marching towards providingmore and more e-governance based services.All of these developments are a testament to the fact that India has been one of the fewcountries where innovation in technology and digital connectivity has been and continuesto be led by the public sector. The success of UPI, a common platform that serves asthe backbone for diverse developments, has prompted government to task itself withanother innovative attempt towards democratising digital commerce through the ONDCwhich could potentially transform how businesses and consumers interact at present.Empowering the end-users with control over their data is an essential ongoing task thatis guided by the Account Aggregator framework.As the developments would indicate, the world has moved seamlessly from the focuson physical infrastructure to investing in digital infrastructure. Moving forward, it isalmost a certainty that most of the future real-world applications are going to marrythe two, something akin to that attempted under Smart Cities, that interlocks area-baseddevelopment with digital assets and digital services.In the context of unique challenges, which only a country with a billion people can face,India’s infrastructure journey has been global in outlook, but domestic in innovation andimplementation. Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 343introduction12.1 As India completes 75 years of Independence, the nation is evolving into a prominentforce in the global economic order. India is the world’s fifth largest economy and the prospect ofsteady progress in the coming years is bright. Here, the critical role played by infrastructure ineconomic growth cannot be overemphasised. Investing in high-quality infrastructure1 is crucialfor accelerating economic growth and sustaining it in the long run. As the empirical evidencestates, this has a salutary effect on the productivity and efficiency of Indian manufacturing firms2.It further plays a significant role in poverty reduction3 and promotes both rural and agriculturaldevelopment4,5. Empirical evidence also points to the positive effect of infrastructure towardsbringing overall economic growth in India6.  strongly correlated100000800006000040000200000100 600 1100 1600 2100tnerruc,atipacrepPDG$lanoitanretni120000100000800006000040000Correlation: 0.75 2000001 3 5 7Total infrastructure investment percapita, constant 2015 US$tnerruc,atipacrepPDG$lanoitanretniCorrelation: 0.76Quality of overall infrastructureNote: The left graph pertains to 2019, and the right graph pertains to 2018.Quality of overall infrastructure: 1=worst and 7=best.Source: World Bank, Global Infrastructure Hub, and World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index12.2 The above correlation between infrastructure and development brings us to the presentscenario when during the times of pandemic and geo-political crisis, the government kept itsfocus on reforms in areas of physical, digital and regulatory infrastructure. In order to increase theprivate sector participation in creation of new infrastructure and development of existing ones,the government took initiatives like Public-Private Partnership (PPP), National InfrastructurePipeline (NIP) and National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP). In addition to this, as part of thestructural reforms with the objective to enhance efficiencies and cost competitiveness, Gati1 In a broad sense, the term infrastructure refers to the “…physical facilities, institutions and organisational structures, or the social and eco-nomic foundations, for the operation of a society” (World Investment Report 2008: Transnational Corporations and the Infrastructure Challenge.United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.). The present chapter focuses only on emerging issues in the context of physical anddigital infrastructure. Separate chapters of this survey provide in-depth views on social infrastructure and financial infrastructure related issues.2 Mitra, A., Varoudakis, A., & Véganzonès‐Varoudakis, M. (2002).

This buffet of reforms on allaspects related to infrastructure investment and project execution not just ensures economicgrowth and economic efficiency but also generates confidence among various stakeholders inthe economy towards government functioning.12.3 Building upon it, the government has also kept its focus towards developing the traditionalinfrastructure like roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport and waterways. These play avital role in national integration and regional development. The mechanisms like multi-modaltransport system have also been put in place. The multi-modal connectivity will provide integratedand seamless connectivity for movement of people and goods from one mode of transport toanother. It will facilitate the last mile connectivity and also reduce travel time for people, furtherreducing the logistics cost and promoting export competitiveness. These measures collectivelycan bring out the untapped potential of underutilised modes of infrastructure.12.4 With increasing financialisation of the economy and penetration of digital services, growthin physical infrastructure alone could not be the answer for development. Though India's digitaljourney predates the pandemic, it would be rational to say that the testing times of the pandemichave accelerated its acceptance, application and coverage in many ways. The adaptabilitydisplayed by the citizens towards technology-driven changes was very encouraging. Thisconfluence of digitisation and innovation acted as a game changer for India.12.5 Reflecting on the journey of digital infrastructure growth and its global adoption, it ispertinent to mention that in 2009, only 17 per cent of adults in India had bank accounts, 15per cent used digital payments, 1 in 25 had a unique ID document, and about 37 per cent hadmobile phones. Today, these numbers have seen a meteoric rise — tele density has reached upto 93 per cent, over a billion people have a digital ID document, more than 80 per cent havebank accounts, and as of 2022, over 600 crore of digital payment transactions are completed permonth. A Bank for International Settlements (BIS) working paper7 has estimated that progresstowards financial inclusion, which would have taken almost half a century had India followedtraditional growth processes, was achieved in India in just about ten years.12.6 Today, India is able to offer many best practices, particularly with respect to its digitalinfrastructure innovations, that can be emulated globally. Successful vaccination drive throughthe one-stop Co-WIN portal, DigiLocker, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), OpenCredit Enablement Network (OCEN), Goods and Services Tax (GST) Sahay are a few successstories among many. The National Payments Corporation of India International (NPCIL) ledUnified Payment Interface (UPI) is another such innovation which transformed the paymentlandscape. UPI based transactions grew both in value and volume terms, paving the way for itsinternational adoption.12.7 Capitalising on the digital infrastructure support, India has also emerged as one of theworld's most vibrant destinations for start-up ecosystems. Start-ups are being envisioned as thespine of new India, as they encourage the youth to become job creators rather than job seekers.With the highest FinTech adoption rate of 87 per cent among the public compared to the globalaverage of 64 per cent, India has gained the 3rd place in digital payments8 only after US and7 https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap106.pdf, page 4.8 https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/fintech/indias-fintech-market-size-at-31-billion-in-2021-third-largest-in-worldreport/88794336 BLinC per cent20report_Fintech_2022.pdf Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 345China, signifying that India has an untapped market. These untapped opportunities, along with thefavourable ecosystem, creates a large growth potential for FinTechs in India. Taking this visionforward, under the government's policy initiative, a world-class FinTech Hub at Gujarat InternationalFinance Tec-City (GIFT) International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) has been developed.12.8 This is just an illustration of the opportunities that exist. The massive wave of digitisation,increased penetration of smartphones, and adoption of technology have opened the doors forboth traditional and new-age sectors. The rollout of 5G services can unleash new economicopportunities and help the country leapfrog the traditional barriers to development, spurinnovations by start-ups and business enterprises, and advance the 'Digital India' vision. Thejourney is far from complete, and a lot remains to be accomplished to realise our true potential.12.9 To summarise, this chapter covers the recent and past experiences of the government intransforming and inter-locking the potential of physical, regulatory and digital infrastructure.In doing so, the chapter looks to answer the following: How have the various infrastructuralsectors fared after the Covid-19 shock? How has the government leveraged digital technologiesin the service of the public? How far has the government been able to determine the role ofco-ordination and efficiency in infrastructure projects and what is the government’s visiontowards infrastructure development? In doing so, we will cover the government’s plans to placeIndia among the top three global economies and inch closer to the status of a developed nationby the 100th year of its Independence.government’s Vision and approaches to infrastructure development in india12.10 Increase in infrastructure investment provides a critical push to the potential growth ofthe economy. The government, in recent years, provided an increased impetus for infrastructuredevelopment and investment through the enhancement of capital expenditure. This push hashappened at a time of crisis when the capital expenditure by the private sector has been subdued.The outlay (target) for capital expenditure in 2022-23 (BE) was increased sharply by 35.4 per centfrom ₹ 5.5 lakh crore in the previous year (2021-22) to ₹ 7.5 lakh crore, of which approximately67 per cent has been spent from April to December 2022. s*16.0 40%34% 35%14.0 35%12.0 30%10.0 22% 25%7.58.0 20%13% 5.56.0 15%4.14.0 3.4 10%2.0 5%0.0 0%FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23)erorChkaL₹(erutidnepxelatipaC)tnecrep(htworgGBS YoY growth in Capex* All  India 346 Economic Survey 2022-2312.11 The result of the efforts is visible in Ministries’/ Departments’ Capex spending tillDecember 2022, which has been ₹5 lakh crore (around 67 per cent has been achieved againstthe Budgeted Capex of 7.5 lakh crore) as against ₹3.9 lakh crore for the same period in FY22(i.e., till December 2021). The actual expenditure in FY23 is also 28 per cent higher than theexpenditure in FY22 for the corresponding period.12.12 The steady increase in public capital expenditure has helped support economic growthwhile laying the foundation for future growth as capital assets boost economic efficiency andpotential growth. It could also crowd in private investment, as the IMF observed in the caseof India9. This is evident from the fact that capacity utilisation in the private sector has beenrecovering.12.13 While the NIP and the NMP would provide the much-needed impetus for stepping upinfrastructure investment, the NLP will address the gaps in services, digital infrastructure andskills in the logistics workforce. PM GatiShakti, with a multimodal approach, is designed tofill the gaps in physical infrastructure and to integrate existing and proposed infrastructuredevelopment initiatives of different agencies. As physical infrastructure requires continuoussupport over its long gestation period, the government has also set up National Bank forFinancing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) as development financial institution to setin motion a virtuous investment cycle. An institutional mechanism to fast-track investments hasbeen put in place, in the form of Project Development Cells (PDCs) in all concerned Ministries/Departments of Government of India.12.14 The government’s vision for infrastructure does not stop here. As India has alreadysubmitted its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy at COP27, the next leap wouldbe towards advanced infrastructure, which is more energy efficient, incorporates the idea of acircular economy and transitions towards low carbon development. The amount of investmentthat may be needed for putting in place climate resilient and climate resistant infrastructuremight be too vast to be provided for by either the public sector or the private sector alone. Bothfinancing and the creation of such infrastructure are likely to require Public-Private Partnership,a topic to which we turn next.Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)12.15 Private investment in infrastructure is mainly in the form of PPPs. PPPs are vital instrumentsfor governments in channelling the strength of private sector in critical areas of infrastructure. Ithelps to address infrastructure gap and improve efficiency in infrastructure service delivery. Thevery success of PPPs lies in the robustness of institutional structure, financial support, and useand availability of standardised documents, such as Model Request for Qualification (RFQ),Model Request for Proposal (RFP) and Model Concession Agreements (MCAs).12.16 In India, private participation in infrastructure programmes supports several PPP models,including management contracts like Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer (DBFOT), Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer (ROT), Hybrid Annuity Model(HAM), and Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) model. Under the BOT model, there are two variants– BOT (Toll) and BOT (Annuity) depending on who bears the traffic risk. In the case of BOT9 Bahal, Girish & Raissi, Mehdi & Tulin, Volodymyr. (2018). Crowding-Out or Crowding-In? Public and Private Investment in India. Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 347(Toll), the traffic risk is borne by the PPP concessionaire, while in the case of BOT (Annuity), itis borne by the public authority.12.17 The Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC), the apex body for appraisalof PPP projects in the Central Sector has streamlined appraisal mechanism to ensure speedyappraisal of projects, eliminate delays, adopt international best practices and have uniformity inappraisal mechanism and guidelines. The PPPAC is chaired by Secretary, Department of EconomicAffairs (DEA) with Secretaries of Department of Expenditure, Department of Legal Affairs, theSponsoring Ministry/Department and CEO, NITI Aayog as members to consider and appraise theproposals for Central Sector PPP Projects. The Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committeehas cleared 79 projects with a total project cost of ₹2,27,268.1 crore from FY15 to FY23.12.18 To provide financial assistance to financially unviable but socially/ economicallydesirable PPP projects, DEA launched the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme in 2006. Underthis scheme, economic sector projects may get up to 40 per cent of Capex as VGF grant. TheScheme includes higher provisions of VGF grant for social sectors. Social sectors may get upto 80 per cent of the Capex and up to 50 per cent of the Operating Expenditure (Opex) for fiveyears after Commercial Operation Date (CoD) as VGF grant.12.19 Social Sector projects get VGF under two categories: Sub Scheme-1 and Sub-Scheme-2.Sub-Scheme-1 caters to social sectors such as wastewater treatment, water supply, solid wastemanagement etc. The projects under this category should have at least 100 per cent OperationalCost recovery. The Government of India (GoI) will provide a maximum of 30 per cent of Capexand the State Government concerned may provide an additional support of up to 30 per cent ofCapex. Sub-scheme 2 supports demonstration/pilot projects from Health & Education sectors. Theprojects eligible under this category should have at least 50 per cent Operational Cost recovery.The GoI will provide a maximum of 40 per cent of the Capex of the project and a maximum of 25per cent of the Opex of the project for the first five years of commercial operations as VGF.12.20 From 2014-15 to 2022-23, under the VGF Scheme, 56 projects with TPC of ₹57870.1crore were granted In-Principle Approval and 27 projects with TPC of ₹25263.8 crore weregranted final approval with a Total Viability Gap Funding approval of ₹5813.6 crore (Both GoI& State Share). The GoI share of approved VGF is ₹3102.6 crore and the State Share of TotalVGF approved is ₹2710.9 crore. The total VGF amount disbursed by DEA under the schemefrom FY15 to FY23 is ₹2982.4 crore.12.21 A scheme for financial support for project development expenses of PPP Projects –the ‘India Infrastructure Project Development Fund Scheme’ (IIPDF) – was notified by thegovernment on 3 November 2022. The aim of the scheme is to develop quality PPP projects byproviding necessary funding support to the project-sponsoring authorities, both in the Centraland State Governments, for creating a shelf of bankable, viable PPP projects by on-boardingtransaction advisers.12.22 IIPDF Scheme has a total outlay of ₹150 crore for a period of 3 years from FY23 toFY25. Under the scheme, a maximum amount of ₹5 crore for a single proposal, inclusive of anytax implications, can be funded, which can include the cost of consultants/transaction advisersof a PPP project. Any funding requirement over and above ₹5 crore may be borne by the projectsponsoring authority itself, and funding under IIPDF shall not be recovered. 348 Economic Survey 2022-23national infrastructure Pipeline (niP)12.23 A developing economy such as ours requires a continued stepping up of infrastructureinvestment to sustain a high rate of growth, which in turn is a pre-requisite for achieving wide-ranging social objectives. In view of this, the government launched the National InfrastructurePipeline (NIP) with a forward-looking approach and with a projected infrastructure investmentof around ₹111 lakh crore during FY20-25 to provide high quality infrastructure across thecountry. It also envisages improving project preparation and attracting domestic and foreigninvestment in infrastructure. The NIP includes infrastructure projects of more than ₹100 crorecovering greenfield and brownfield investments. The NIP currently has 8,964 projects witha total investment of more than ₹108 lakh crore under different stages of implementation.Regarding sectoral composition, the transport sector constituted more than half of the projects.

IIG thusacts as a centralised portal to track and review project progress across all economic and socialinfrastructure sub-sectors. The portal also enables project-sponsoring authorities to showcaseinvestment opportunities to national and international investors. Project Monitoring Group(PMG) is an institutional mechanism put in place by the government for resolution of issuesrelated to large-scale projects. PMG is also involved in the fast-tracking of approvals/clearances Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 349for projects with an anticipated investment of ₹500 crore and above. Now, it has been proposedto integrate NIP and PMG portals. When implemented, NIP will become the first entry point(database) for all infrastructure projects (costing ₹100 crore or more). PMG portal will pick updata, as per requirements (project cost of ₹500 crore or more), from the NIP database. This willsave substantial time and effort by Ministries and States/UTs and ease the monitoring of largeinfrastructure projects.national Monetisation Pipeline – creation through monetisation12.25 The need for scaling up infrastructure investment despite fiscal pressures from Covid-19pandemic required unlocking of capital from various projects across sectors. The NationalMonetisation Pipeline (NMP), was thus announced on 23 August 2021. Based on the principle of‘asset creation through monetisation’, it taps private sector investment for new infrastructure creation.12.26 It is expected that private players would operate and maintain the assets. The NMP providesan opportunity for deleveraging balance sheets and providing fiscal space for investment in newinfrastructure assets. The estimated aggregate monetisation potential under NMP is ₹6.0 lakh crorethrough core assets of the Central Government, over a four-year period, from FY20-25.12.27 The process of monetisation entails a limited period license/ lease of an asset, owned bythe government or a public authority, to a private sector entity for upfront or periodic consideration.Funds so received by the public authority are reinvested in new infrastructure or deployed for otherpublic purposes. Such contracts include provisions for the transfer of assets back to the authority atthe end of the contract period. It includes a selection of de-risked and brownfield assets with a stablerevenue generation profile (or long-term revenue rights) that can be clearly ring-fenced. It contains20+ asset classes across 12+ line ministries/ departments. In addition, the top 5 sectors (by estimatedvalue) capture around 83 per cent of the aggregate pipeline value: roads (27 per cent) followed byrailways (25 per cent), power (15 per cent), oil & gas pipelines (8 per cent), and telecom (6 per cent).Roads and railways together contribute around 52 per cent of the total NMP value.12.28 Against the monetisation target of ₹0.9 lakh crore in FY22, ₹0.97 lakh crore have beenachieved during the period under roads, power, coal and mines. The cumulative investmentpotential over the years of transactions completed is estimated at ₹9.0 lakh crore (value capturedin the form of accruals, receipts, and/or private investment). NMP’s 2nd year, i.e., FY23, targetenvisaged is ₹1.6 lakh crore (27 per cent of overall NMP Target) under Core-Asset Monetisation.This is an indicative value while the actual realization for public assets may differ depending onthe timing, transaction structuring, investor interest, etc.national logistics Policy: reducing the cost of logistics12.29 Given that India aims to increase its exports manifold, it is important that the logisticsaspects, that will facilitate this goal, be addressed. Logistics costs in India have been in therange of 14-18 per cent of GDP against the global benchmark of 8 per cent. Key dimensions tobe addressed to improve logistics for trade include: ensuring efficiency of the clearance process(i.e., speed, simplicity, and predictability of formalities) by border control agencies, includingcustoms; improving the quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure (e.g., ports, railroads,roads, information technology); easing of arranging competitively priced shipments; enhancingthe competence and quality of logistics services (e.g., transport operators, customs brokers); 350 Economic Survey 2022-23providing for tracking and tracing of consignments and ensuring timeliness of shipments inreaching destinations within the scheduled or expected delivery time. These aspects have beencaptured by the World Bank in the form of a Logistics Performance Index (LPI).12.30 Many efforts have already been made by the Government of India to improve the logisticsecosystem through ‘infrastructure initiatives’ such as Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN),Bharatmala, Sagarmala, Parvatamala, National Rail Plan, and through ‘process reforms’ GST,e-Sanchit, Single Window Interface for Trade (SWIFT), Indian Customs Electronic DataInterchange Gateway (ICEGATE), Turant Customs, and others.12.31 However, a need was felt to integrate all these efforts by different government agenciesand lay an overarching interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral, and multi-jurisdictional framework forthe logistics sector. To realise this idea, NLP was launched on 17 September 2022, addressingthe components of improving efficiency in logistics through streamlining processes, regulatoryframework, skill development, and mainstreaming logistics among others.12.32 The vision of the NLP is “to develop a technologically enabled, integrated, cost-efficient,resilient, sustainable and trusted logistics ecosystem in the country for accelerated and inclusivegrowth.” The policy is an endeavour to improve the competitiveness of Indian goods, enhanceeconomic growth and increase employment opportunities. It is aimed at bringing global standardsto warehousing, multimodal digital integration, ease of logistics services, human resources, andskill enhancement.12.33 The targets for achieving the vision of the NLP are to (i) reduce the cost of logistics inIndia to be comparable to global benchmarks by 2030; (ii) improve the Logistics PerformanceIndex ranking - endeavour is to be among the top 25 countries by 2030, and (iii) create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem.12.34 The Policy will be implemented through a Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP).The interventions under the CLAP are divided into specific key action areas, including IntegratedDigital Logistics Systems, standardisation of physical assets & benchmarking service qualitystandards, Logistics Human Resources Development and Capacity Building, State Engagement,EXIM (Export-Import) Logistics, Service Improvement framework, Sectoral Plan for EfficientLogistics and Facilitation of Development of Logistics Parks.12.35 Among other steps taken to enhance logistics performance in the country, there has beenan initiative to undertake a sub-national view of the state of logistics in the country throughthe Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) index. The following Box provides somedetails of this initiative.10Box Xii.1: logistics ease across different statesThe Government undertook a survey-based assessment of logistics ease in various Statesand UTs in the form of the LEADS index in 2018 to gauge their logistics ecosystem. It wasfollowed by surveys in 2019, 2021, and 202210. Each of these surveys has been aimed atanalysing the business environment at the State level relating to the logistics infrastructure,policy framework, and regulatory regime, across States and UTs.10 The survey could not be undertaken in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 351It is based on a stakeholders’ survey and uses the World Bank’s Logistics PerformanceIndex (LPI) methodology. The State LPI is arrived at using a ranking methodology forstakeholder engagement based on a series of meetings and online surveys in the key areas oflogistics- infrastructure, services timelines, traceability, competitiveness, security, operatingenvironments, and efficiency of regulation. Following the LEADS initiative, 13 States/UTshave prepared and notified their logistic policies.The LEADS 2022 survey report was released on 13 October 2022, which considered thePM GatiShakti NMP and current developments in the logistics sector in the wake of theCOVID-19 pandemic. The survey has garnered more than 6500 responses from more than 2100respondents across the country. Unlike the previous versions of LEADS which were basedon ranking systems for all states, LEADS 2022 has adopted a classification-based grading,and States have been now classified under four categories viz., coastal States, hinterland/landlocked States, North-Eastern States, and UTs for the assessment of how well a State or UThas performed in comparison to the top State/UT within the specific cluster.Taking a break from the past, states have not been ranked in order. This time, they have beenallotted three performance categories, namely, Achievers: States/UTs achieving a percentagescore of 90 per cent or more, Fast Movers: States/UTs achieving percentage scores between 80to 90 per cent, and Aspirers: States/UTs achieving percentage scores below 80 per cent.

Introducing the holistic planning in the caseof infrastructure projects, the government launched PM GatiShakti, charting a transformativeapproach to infrastructure development. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan entailscreation of a common umbrella platform with all infrastructure projects pertaining to variousministries/ departments incorporated within a comprehensive database for efficient planning andimplementation on a real-time basis. The projects pertaining to seven engines (roads, railways,airports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistic infrastructure) in the NIP will be alignedwith PM GatiShakti framework. The touchstone of the Master Plan will be high quality moderninfrastructure and logistics synergy among different modes of movement – both of people andof goods – and location of projects. This will help raise productivity, and accelerate economicgrowth and development.12.37 The focus is on integrated planning and synchronised implementation across ministries/departments, with innovative use of technology. The aim is to improve multimodal connectivityand logistics efficiency while addressing the critical gaps for the seamless movement of people andgoods, with a focus on minimising disruptions and timely completion of infrastructure projects.12.38 In order to facilitate integrated planning and coordinated implementation, a GIS-based and data-driven decision support platform called PM GatiShakti National Master Planhas been introduced. Around 1950 data layers of 22 ministries/departments and 36 States/UTswere mapped up to the village, district, and taluka levels on the national master plan. It can beintegrated with various applications of different ministries/agencies to prevent duplication ofwork and create a single window system for infrastructure planning. Data layers on importantassets pertaining to health, education, culture, tourism, gram panchayats, municipal corporation,social welfare housing etc. are being mapped and data validation is being done for optimumuse of PM GatiShakti principles in planning of both physical and social infrastructures. Usecases of GatiShakti National Master Plan include connectivity to model schools and disastermanagement planning etc.developments in Physical infrastructure sectorsroad transport: increased budgetary support by the government augmented roadconnectivity12.39 Road infrastructure in the form of a network of national highways, state highways, districtroads, rural roads, and urban roads acts as a major mode of transportation and connectivityfor the country’s diverse population of consumers and businesses. Roads supplement the othermodes of transport through last-mile connectivity to the far-flung regions of the country.12.40 There has been an increase in the construction of National Highways (NHs)/roads overtime, with 10,457 km of roads constructed in FY22 as compared to 6,061 km in FY16. In FY23(until October 2022), 4,060 km of NHs/roads were constructed, which was around 91 per centof the achievement in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. Total budgetarysupport for investment in the sector has been increasing rapidly in the last four years and stoodat around ₹1.4 lakh crore during FY23 (as of 31 October 2022). Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 35312.41 In line with the vision of monetisation of public sector assets, National HighwaysAuthority of India (NHAI) launched its InvIT in FY22 not only to facilitate monetisation ofroads but also to attract foreign and domestic institutional investors to invest in the roads sector.So far, NHAI InvIT has raised more than ₹10,200 crore from high quality foreign and Indianinstitutional investors (up to December 2022). s in 2020-2113000110009000700050003000sertemolik61-5102 71-6102 81-7102 91-8102 02-9102 12-0202 22-12025000450040003500300025002000150010005000Apr-Oct 2021 April-Oct 2022sertemolikSource: Ministry of Road Transport and Highways 0.50.02015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 (asof 31October2022)erorchkal₹Total Budgetary Support IEBRPrivate Sector investment Total InvestmentSource: Ministry of Road Transport and Highwaysrailways: expansion and modernisation, a continuous process12.42 A major transport infrastructure, that can very well be called India’s lifeline, and whichhad a huge role to play in national integration and regional development, is the railways. TheIndian Railways (IR), with over 68,031 route kms, is the fourth largest network in the worldunder single management. Passenger traffic originating in IR was 809 crore during pre-Covid-19period (2019-20), but dipped to 125 crore in 2020-21. It has since recovered to 351.9 crore in2021-22. During the current financial year, passenger traffic has seen further strong growthwith the number of originating passengers already hitting 418.4 crore (up to November 2022).Enhanced mobility across the country and demand for faster and competitive trains will assistthe growth in passenger traffic in the coming years.12.43 In the case of revenue-earning, freight traffic was sustained by IR despite the Covid-19shock. Between FY20-21 and FY21-22, there was a sharp increase in the freight traffic, reflectingthe strong revival in the economic activity in the domestic economy. During FY22-23 (up toNovember 2022), Indian Railways (IR) carried 976.8 million tonnes of revenue-earning freight 354 Economic Survey 2022-23traffic (excluding KRCL11), as against 901.7 million tonnes during the corresponding period inFY21-22 (excluding KRCL), which translated into an increase of 8.3 per cent. 009008007006005004003002001000)erorCni(ciffarTregnessaPyawliaR51-4102 61-5102 71-6102 81-7102 91-8102 02-9102 12-0202 22-1202 *32-22021450 1415.914001350130012501200115011001050ciffartthgierfgninraeeuneveR)sennotnoillim()LCRK.lcxe(51-4102 61-5102 71-6102 81-7102 91-8102 02-9102 12-0202 22-1202Note: * For FY23 the data is from April-November, 2022Source: Ministry of Railways12.44 The capital expenditure (Capex) on infrastructure in railways has received tremendousboost since 2014.

This is further supported bythe government through schemes such as UDAN, which has considerably enhanced regionalconnectivity through the opening of airports in India’s hinterland. Under this scheme, thegovernment has approved a budget of ₹4500 crore for revival of existing unserved/ underservedairports/airstrips of the State governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI), public sectorundertakings and civil enclaves. The government has also accorded 'in-principle' approval for thesetting up of 21 greenfield airports across the country. More than one crore air passengers haveavailed themselves of the benefit of the UDAN scheme since its inception. The scheme focuseson the connectivity between the Tier-2 and 3 cities in the country and the number of beneficiarieswill increase manifold as the connectivity improves between unserved and underserved airports.Ports: handling higher capacity with governance reforms12.48 For ages, the sea has been the source of opportunity and seashores have acted as thegateways to prosperity for India. The development of ports is crucial for the economy, given that Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 357most of the international trade is handled through ports (around 90 per cent of international tradecargo by volume and 79.9 per cent by value). The capacity of major ports, which was 871.5Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) at the end of March 2014, has increased to 1534.9 MTPAby the end of March 2022. Cumulatively they handled 720.1 MT traffic during FY22.12.49 To meet the ever-increasing trade requirements, the expansion of port capacity has beenaccorded the highest priority by the government through the implementation of well-conceivedinfrastructure development projects. To further enhance their efficiency, the government isfocusing on improving port governance, addressing low-capacity utilisation, modernisingberths with techno efficient loading/unloading equipment, and creating new channels for portconnectivity. For streamlining the port compliances and for reducing the Turn Around Timefor (TAT) for vessels, long strides have been taken at the major ports towards the digitisationof key EXIM processes. The Port Community System (PCS 1x) has digitised processes suchas Electronic Invoice (e-Invoice), Electronic Payment (e-Payment) and Electronic DeliveryOrder (e-DO) for the physical release of cargo by custodians, in addition to the processesof generating electronic Bill of Lading (e-BL) and Letter of Credit (LC). Further, the RadioFrequency Identification Device (RFID) solution has been implemented at all major portsto enable seamless movement of traffic across port gates, including substantial reductions indocumentation checks. Additionally, the process to bootstrap PCS 1x into National LogisticsPortal-Marine (NLP-Marine) is already under way which will act as a Unified Digital Platformfor all maritime stakeholders.inland water transport: tapping the potential of navigable waterways12.50 Inland water transport holds great untapped potential as a means for the transportation ofgoods and passengers. India has a large endowment of rivers, canals, and other waterways. Thetotal navigable length of waterways in India is around 14,850 kilometres. liKlagneBtseWmassA alareK ahsidO akatanraK hsedarParhdnArahiB arthsarahaM **hsedarPrattUdnalagaN aoG udaNlimaTSource: Statistics of Inland Water Transport 2020-21, Ministry of Port, Shipping and WaterwaysNote: Data pertains to 2020-21. **Data for Uttar Pradesh pertains to 2016-17 358 Economic Survey 2022-2312.51 Under the National Waterways Act 2016, 106 new waterways have been declared asNational Waterways (NWs), taking the total number of NWs in the country to 111. Based on theoutcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), 26 NWs viablefor cargo movement have been prioritised, out of which developmental activities have beeninitiated in the 14 most viable NWs. Further, to promote the use of inland waterways, waterwayusage charges levied by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) on vessels moving onNWs were waived in July 2020, initially for a period of three years. The cargo movement onNational Waterways achieved an all-time high of 108.8 million tons during FY22, recording30.1 per cent growth compared to the previous year.12.52 The Inland Vessels Bill 2021, which replaced the over 100 year-old Inland Vessels Act,1917 (Act No.1 of 1917), was passed by the Parliament in August 2021. This will usher in a newera for inland water transport sector and fulfil the vision to utilise the potential of multi-modaltransport ecosystem while making the legislative framework user-friendly and promoting easeof doing business. The uniform application of rules and regulations will ensure seamless, quick,and cost-efficient trade and transportation by inland vessels using the inland waterways. Varioussections of this Act as detailed in the box below have come into force in 2022.Box Xii.3: inland Vessels act 2021The Inland Vessels Act of 1917, which had undergone several amendments, had provisions forthe restrictive movement of mechanically propelled vessels and non-uniform standards andregulations across different states. The Inland Vessels Act 2021, which replaced the erstwhileAct, aims to bring uniformity in the application of the law relating to inland waterways andnavigation within the country. Some salient features of the Act include:State governments may declare by notification any inland water area as a “Zone”depending on the maximum significant wave height criteria as prescribed in the Act. Anymechanically propelled vessel would have to obtain a certificate, which would indicatethe zone in which the vessel is to be operated.A central database of inland vessels would be maintained by the government.The standards for qualification, training, training institutes, examination, and grant ofcertificate of competency would be prescribed by the Central Government.Standards for prevention of environmental pollution.Constitution of a Development Fund by the State Government to be utilised for meetingemergency preparedness, containment of pollution, removal of unidentified wrecks orobstruction, boosting development works of inland water navigation, etc.Overall, the new Act would lead to uniformity of rules across states ensuring unhindered andsafe movement of vessels within and across states. This is likely to promote inland watertransport as a potential mode for large-scale movement of cargo as well as passengers acrossthe country owing to its relative cost effectiveness.

As on 30 September 2022, the government has sanctioned theentire target capacity of 40 GW for the development of 59 Solar Parks in 16 states.12.56 Indian Railways, which is a major user of electricity in the country, has announcedits intention to achieve net zero carbon emission by 2030. In this regard, Indian Railways hasreoriented its energy demand towards greater use of renewable sources. As of November 2022,plants generating about 143 MW of solar power (both on rooftops and on land) and about 103MW of wind power have been commissioned.12.57 Other important incentives for renewable power generation include HydropowerPurchase Obligation (HPO) within Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO). Withthe government support, the private sector has actively participated in boosting the overallgeneration capacity and bringing down unit costs over a short period.developments in digital infrastructure12.58 While the role of traditional infrastructure has been well recognised, in recent years,the role of digital infrastructure in socio-economic development of the country has assumedan increased importance. This was especially true during the Covid-19 period when thecurtailment of physical interactions necessitated the utilisation of digital infrastructure alreadyavailable for service delivery and remote work. In the coming years, the availability and spreadof digital infrastructure will contribute significantly to economic growth. Recognising this,the government’s Digital India programme, which aims to transform India into a digitallyempowered society and knowledge economy, envisions digital infrastructure as a core utility toevery citizen. The focus areas include the availability of high-speed internet as a core utility fordelivery of services to citizens, unique digital identity, enabling citizen participation in digitaland financial space, shareable private space on a public cloud (citizens can digitally store theirdocuments, certificates, etc. and share them with public agencies or others without the need tophysically submit them), and a safe and secure cyber-space. Some developments in the digitalinfrastructure sphere are detailed below.Telecommunications: Accelerating provision of affordable services12.59 As a result of the persistent efforts made by the government towards promotingtechnological development, telecommunications services have penetrated the remotest cornersof the nation. The country has come a long way from the days when a telephone connectionwas seen as a luxury to the present where a majority of people have a mobile connection.This was due to a cumulative effort of telecom players who widened their network bandwidth,government’s enabling environment and consumers’ outreach for smartphones. Today, the totaltelephone subscriber base in India stands at 117 crore (as of November 2022). While more than97 per cent of the total subscribers are connected wirelessly (114.3 crore at the end of November2022), 83.7 crore have internet connections as of June 2022. The overall tele-density in Indiastood at 84.8 per cent, with wide differences across states. It ranged from 55.4 per cent inBihar to 270.6 per cent in Delhi. Eight license service areas, namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 361Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka had a tele-density of above 100per cent.

However, the catch-up by the rural areasis heartening as the YoY change in internet subscribers is greater in rural (for the majority ofthe states) than in urban areas. This provided a cushion to the rural economy during the initialphase of the Covid-19 as many people went back to rural India for their livelihood. The digitalinfrastructure created over the years ensured not just the continuous transmission of informationbut also added economic value when businesses went digital.Box Xii.4: lessening the rural-urban digital divideConverting the crisis into opportunity, India, through its resilient measures, has been able tocontain the impact of the pandemic through structural reforms in several sectors, telecom beingone of them. During the challenging times of Covid-19 pandemic, the telecommunication sectorcontinued to provide seamless connectivity for the smooth functioning of critical activitiesand services such as ‘work from home’, ‘study from home’ etc. This was supported by thesignificant increase in affordable smartphones, which became more than a communicationdevice. It emerged as the key enabler of Digital India initiative with various new servicesand applications like digital payments, e-governance, e-commerce, e-health, and e-education.Acting as the backbone, these services have boosted the overall economic growth of thecountry.Before 2014, access to digital services was perceived as a prerogative of urban households. 362 Economic Survey 2022-23This was substantiated by the then-existing digital divide seen from tele density (number ofsubscribers per 100 inhabitants) in rural and urban areas being 44.01 and 145.46 respectivelyin 2014. However, with the vision of developing digital infrastructure as a core utility forevery citizen, Digital India as an umbrella programme was launched in 2015. Service deliverythrough digital tools has travelled a long way since then. We have added more internetsubscribers in rural areas in the last 3 years (2019-21) than in their urban counterparts (95.76million vis-a-vis 92.81 million in rural and urban areas respectively). This has been a resultof dedicated digital drives across rural areas through ambitious government schemes, likethe flagship BharatNet Project Scheme, Telecom Development Plan, Aspirational DistrictScheme, initiatives in North-Eastern Region through Comprehensive Telecom DevelopmentPlan (CTDP) and initiatives towards areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE)etc. 150100500-50-100-150-200-250tnecrephsedarParhdnAmassA rahiB ihleD tarajuG anayraH hsedarPlahcamiHrimhsaK&ummaJakatanraK alareK atakloK hsedarPayhdaMarthsarahaM iabmuM tsaEhtroNassirO bajnuP nahtsajaR udaNlimaT)tsaE(PU)tseW(PUlagneBtseW2018 2019 2020 2021This concrete focus on bridging the gap between rural and urban internet penetration has bornepositive results. The plot of the difference in the growth rates (per cent) of internet subscribersin rural over urban areas is somewhat volatile across states and years. The steep transitionfrom a negative gap1 2in 2018 for most LSAs to above 50 per cent in positive territory (for amajority of LSAs) in 2019 reflects the demand side growth in digital services, which wasbacked by the availability of budget smartphones and affordable data usage. The differencehas been positive since then.This significant growth in rural India was the major shock absorber during the COVID-19pandemic when both businesses and consumer demand were impacted. When majority of theworkforce reverse-migrated to rural areas in search of livelihoods, agriculture (3.4 per centgrowth in FY20-21) as well as the world’s largest employment scheme MNREGA supportedthe domestic economy. The digital infrastructure created over the years in rural areas ensuredtransparent and timely payments to the beneficiaries directly into their account thus limitingtheir exposure to the virus. With affordability and accessibility to private education restricted,12 per cent change in Rural subscriptions - per cent change in Urban subscriptions. Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 363the digital support system in government schools absorbed the then much-needed enrolmentto counter the learning gap. As schooling went online for a considerable period even post-pandemic, the increase in internet subscriptions in rural areas helped mitigate learning losssignificantly. This even facilitated the successful rollout of mass vaccination in rural areas.The 200 per cent increase in rural internet subscriptions between 2015 and 2021 vis-a-vis158 per cent in urban areas, reflects the increased impetus the government is putting tobring rural and urban digital connectivity to the same level. For further widening the net, toinclude unconnected areas and populations, dedicated long-term efforts by the governmenthave been taken. Government Schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for telecomand networking products will promote domestic mobile manufacturing as well as networkinstallation. Continuous proliferation of measures such as Bharat Net Project shall continue toimprove accessibility, affordability, connectivity, and inclusivity pan-India. This in turn willhelp in realizing the vision of our Hon’ble Prime Minister to digitally empower every Indian,as we march towards India’s ‘Techade’.12.61 To further create digital linkages at the grassroots level and increase the consumerexperience like the one in urban centres, a project for the saturation of 4G mobile services inuncovered villages across the country has been approved. The project will provide 4G mobileservices in 24,680 uncovered villages in remote and difficult areas, and 6,279 villages havingonly 2G/3G connectivity shall be upgraded to 4G.12.62 With a special focus on the states in the North-Eastern Region, the government isimplementing a Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP). Under CTDP for NER,mobile connectivity on 2G is to be provided by setting up 2004 towers in the uncovered villagesand along National Highways of Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, andArunachal Pradesh (National Highways only). As of 25 October 2021, 1,358 towers have beeninstalled and they are operational. In addition, other projects on providing 4G mobile coverageto uncovered villages in Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and two districts of Assam (KarbiAnglong & Dima Hasao) are under way. Furthermore, to make available high-quality and high-speed internet access to the states of the North-Eastern Region of the country, Universal ServiceObligation Fund (USOF) signed an Agreement with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL)on 18 August 2021 for the hiring of 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) International Bandwidthfor Internet Connectivity to Agartala from Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited(BSCCL), Bangladesh. The first 10 Gbps link was commissioned on 26 November 2021, andthe second 10 Gbps link on 21 April 2022.12.63 When telecom is spanning coastlines, forests, and even deserts why should islandsbe left behind? A comprehensive initiative to connect our islands to the mainland has beenrealised through the government’s initiative of the Comprehensive Telecom Development Planfor Islands. The Submarine OFC connectivity from Chennai to Andaman & Nicobar Islands(CANI) project was launched to connect Port Blair and seven other islands of Andaman &Nicobar Islands with Chennai through 2,313 km of underwater OFC. There has been an immense 364 Economic Survey 2022-23proliferation of bandwidth utilisation, almost 30 times, from 2.7Gbps to 75.7Gbps. The projecthas led to an FTTH speed of 100 Mbps, and up to 15 times more data volume is availablenow. The Submarine OFC connectivity from Kochi to Lakshadweep Islands (KLI) project waslaunched to connect Kochi with Kavaratti and ten other islands of Lakshadweep through 1869kms of underwater OFC project, and the project is likely to be completed by May 2023. Theproject is currently under way and will ensure digital inclusion across the islands and is expectedto trigger significant transformation across all sectors, including agriculture, tourism, health,and education.12.64 A landmark achievement in telecommunications in India was the launch of 5G services.5G could impact consumers directly through higher data transfer speeds and lower latency. 5Guse cases developed by Telecom Service Providers and start-ups in education, health, workersafety, smart agriculture etc., are now being deployed across the country. Telecom reforms andclear policy direction led to the spectrum auction of 2022 garnering the highest-ever bids.12.65 As a major reform measure, the Indian Telegraph Right of Way (Amendment) Rules,2022, will facilitate faster and easier deployment of telegraph infrastructure to enable speedy5G rollout. The government has brought in procedural reforms in Wireless Licensing,including delicensing of various frequency bands to promote innovation, manufacturing andexport. The National Frequency Allocation Plan 2022 (NFAP) provides a broad regulatoryframework, identifying which frequency bands are available for cellular mobile services, Wi-fi,sound and television broadcasting, radio navigation for aircraft and ships, and other wirelesscommunications. NFAP will give guidance to the users of the spectrum to plan their networks inaccordance with the relevant frequency and parameters provided therein. Given that spectrumis a scarce resource, NFAP is useful in aligning spectrum usage with demands from emergingtechnologies in an efficient manner.12.66 To propel growth and to accelerate the provisioning of affordable services to the citizensin the fast-emerging area of satellite-based services, reforms have been undertaken to promoteease of doing business by limiting the multiplicity of charges at different stages of rolling outsatellite-based communication services. To simplify the existing processes, vital changes havealso been carried out to streamline satellite-related clearance processes.12.67 Universal and equitable access to broadband services across the country, especially inrural areas, is an important part of the government’s vision for national digital connectivity.Toward realising that vision, the GatiShakti Sanchar portal was launched on 14 May 2022. Thisportal will streamline the process of Right of Way (RoW) applications and permissions acrossthe country. The portal has been developed keeping in view the vision areas of the NationalBroadband Mission at the core, which are providing broadband infrastructure as a core utility toevery citizen, governance and services on demand and in particular, digital empowerment of thecitizens of our country.12.68 Now, having discussed telecom at length, the next digital story which rings in our ears isradio which has been one of the best media to reach all residents of the country. Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 365Box Xii.5: radio - the waves that connected ..!!In today’s fast-moving social media age, it is noteworthy how one of the components of massmedia, namely the radio has not only persisted as the bulwark for outreach during the times ofpandemic and beyond but in this fast-evolving digital era has also embossed a separate identity ofits own in the hearts of many. Radio continues to be the most affordable and popular medium ofmass communication in India and has been a tool that has consistently helped in empowermentand social development of the people of our country. The accessibility, wide coverage, varietyof programmes, mobility and vernacularity have continued to be reasons for its popularity. Forinstance, the popular ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme where the Prime Minister establishes a dialoguewith the citizens on issues of day-to-day governance reached the milestone of completing its96th episode on 25th December 2022, with more to follow this year.The iconic line “This is All India Radio. The news read by...” rings in our ears as we reminisce howPrasar Bharati, India's autonomous public service broadcaster, has not only been witness to the historyand landmark events of the country, but has also been the proverbial story-teller for all citizens acrossthe country, standing by its motto ‘Bahujan Hitaya: Bahujan Sukhaya’, meaning 'for the happiness ofmany, for the welfare of many'. It broadcasts in 23 languages, 179 dialects from 479 stations acrossthe country, reaching nearly 92 per cent of the area and 99.2 per cent of the total population of thecountry. Prasar Bharati marked its silver jubilee on 23 November 2022, and it is notable how it hasembraced technology, reflected in the fact that over 240 radio services of All India Radio are live-streamed on NewsOnAir App, Prasar Bharati’s official App. These streams have a large number oflisteners not just in India, but globally, in more than 85 countries across the world.Along with the public broadcaster, private commercial radio stations (FM Radio) andCommunity Radio Stations (CRS) each serve as platforms for a variety of programmes. FMRadio has flourished in the last few years, as observed in the quarterly growth in private FMRadio stations, with their number increasing from 243 in the quarter ending December 2015to 388 in quarter ending June 202213.40038036034032030028026024022020051-ceD 61-raM 61-nuJ 61-peS 61-ceD 71-raM 71-nuJ 71-peS 71-ceD 81-raM 81-nuJ 81-peS 81-ceD 91-raM 91-nuJ 91-peS 91-ceD 02-raM 02-nuJ 02-peS 02-ceD 12-raM 12-nuJ 12-peS 12-ceD 22-raM 22-nuJIncrease in number of FM radio stations 366 Economic Survey 2022-23The rising number of FM radio stations depicts how radio as mass media has satisfactorilydelivered on their mandate of public service and stood strong with the people during thetime of the pandemic. While FM increased its outreach to even far-flung rural areas, CRStargeted local and well-defined communities. The daunting task of spreading awarenesson the pandemic, and that too in vernacular, with innumerable dialects, was made possible,as CRS channelized the community partnerships. In times when the reach of centralizedmedia to every nook and corner of the country was a gargantuan task, these radio wavestravelled without interruption for the larger public cause. They not only became a mediumfor information dissemination but also functioned as a channel for empowerment as virtualeducation also took the recourse of radio.With this, we see the radio as being significantly important through good and tough times. Aswe operate in a new normal and as things settle down with time, these small boxes requiringmanual tuning may again find their place in some household cupboards. However, their identitywill remain intact. It will once again come to the fore to speak for itself with the iconic line“This is All India Radio. The news read by...”.growth story of digital Public infrastructure12.69 The emergence of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), aimed at improving financialliteracy, innovation, entrepreneurship, employment generation, and empowering beneficiarieshas played a critical role in uplifting the economy and bringing it to the stature where it standstoday. The journey of DPI has been remarkably memorable, dating to 2009, when Aadhaarwas first launched. It is fourteen years now, and the digital journey since then has takenthe country quite far. The three growth drivers that acted as catalysts for DPI growth werefavourable demographics, vast expansion of the middle-class, and digital behaviour patterns. Byleveraging these growth drivers, India has built a competitive digital economy that empowersevery individual and business to transact paperless and cashless.12.70 With Aadhaar establishing the authentication framework for verifying the identity ofbeneficiaries of welfare schemes, the next logical step was to make major government servicesavailable digitally. However, a lack of knowledge about the existing schemes was seen as aprimary reason behind the beneficiaries’ inability to access the schemes’ benefits. ‘MyScheme’is an e-Marketplace for schemes where users can look for suitable schemes based on theireligibility. It helps reduce users' time and effort by doing away with the requirement of searchingmultiple websites of government departments and studying multiple scheme guidelines tocheck their eligibility. The scheme also acts as the single national platform for launching anygovernment scheme. As on 16 January, 2023, more than 181 Central and State/UT governmentschemes across 14 diverse categories have been hosted on the portal.13 Data sourced from quarterly Performance Indicator Reports by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 367 heme.gov.in/, accessed on 3rd January 2023.12.71 To reduce the search cost for the commoners, the government launched UnifiedMobile Application for New-Age Governance (UMANG), which enables citizens to accesse-Government services offered by the Central and State Government in various sectors suchas agriculture, education, health, housing, employees, pensioners, and students’ welfare, thePublic Distribution System, and others. Until 16 January 2023, UMANG catered to about 21,869services (1,672 Central and State Govt. services and 20197 Bill Payment services) under 310+departments of Central Government and departments of 34 States/UTs. Over 4.9 crore usersare registered and benefiting from services on UMANG. Four hundred and eighty-nine DBT(Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes were made live on UMANG until September 2022. Duringthe trying times of Covid-19, UMANG was instrumental in making available the services ofEPFO for claims related to Covid-19. Around 4.9 lakh advance claims in EPFO have beenraised via the UMANG Platform until September 2022.12.72 While the initiatives mentioned above focused on bringing the government to the doorstepsof the citizens, a unique initiative that deserves special mention is the Open Network for DigitalCommerce (ONDC). ONDC aims to go beyond the current platform-centric digital commercemodel where the buyer and seller can use the same platform or application for transactions. ONDCis a network-based open protocol that would connect all the buyers and sellers on the network thusbringing better visibility across the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) & Business-to-Business (B2B)landscape. In the ONDC framework, consumers can potentially discover any seller, product,or service by using any compatible application or platform. This will increase the freedom ofchoice for the consumers and will enable them to match demand with the nearest available supply,allowing them to choose their preferred local businesses. ONDC’s beta test in the city of Bengaluruis a major first step in operationalising a network approach to e-commerce as an alternative to aplatform-centric approach. The open network system will make the e-Commerce landscape moreinclusive, accessible, and experience-driven for all consumers and sellers, especially for smallbusinesses that will exercise more freedom in business decision-making. 368 Economic Survey 2022-2312.73 The government is also cognizant of the need to improve the productivity of humancapital. In order to promote open collaborative software development of e-governanceapplications, a platform called OpenForge has been developed. Through OpenForge, the use ofopen-source software and sharing and reuse of e-governance-related source code is promoted.As on 16 January 2023, there are 10,328 users on the platform, with 2,205 projects 14.12.74 Another important domain that the government has emphasised is the availability ofopen resources on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The national AI portal has been developed with aview to strengthening the AI ecosystem in the country by pooling together and highlighting thelatest developments happening in Central and State Governments, industry, academia, NGOs,and civil societies. As on 16 January 2023, it has published 1724 articles, 829 news items, 276videos, 127 research reports, and 120 government initiatives, all related to AI.12.75 In a country such as India, with its unmatched linguistic and cultural diversity, AI hasgreat potential as a tool for overcoming the language barrier. ‘Bhashini’, the National LanguageTranslation Mission, aiming at nurturing Indian language technologies and solutions as a publicgood, was launched in July 2022. The Digital India Bhashini portal15 is a public digital platformon which 260 open-source API-based AI models are available for speech-to-text conversion,machine translation, and text-to-speech conversion in 11 Indian languages and English forvarious purposes. Bhashini has great potential to bring access to the internet and other digitalresources to millions of Indians in their own languages.12.76 The digital landscape is a fast-changing one with overarching technologies arriving atthe doorstep of consumers and businesses. The third generation in web technologies, ‘Web3.0’ is one such example where in the entire experience of the internet is changing in the wayhow it will be used, how websites are managed, and how internet services are provided. Thehorizons of internet use have broadened, and so has their deployment of better standards. TheOpen Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) is one such set of standards that is being hailed as amajor shift in how lending and borrowing will be conducted in the future. This is another goodinitiative towards democratising lending operations and thus ensuring that small borrowers areable to avail themselves of the best terms under which credit is available.12.77 Today, we have a powerful story on digital public infrastructure that is finding globalresonance. The increasing digital adoption during covid-19 in areas like healthcare, agriculture,FinTech, education, and skilling indicates that the digital delivery of services in India has amassive potential across economic sectors. It is usually suggested that developing countriesmust follow global best practices. However, how India has created and harnessed its DPI iscapturing the attention of many nations globally. Low-cost accessibility (Aadhaar), the successof citizen-centric services like Unified Payments Interface (UPI), large-scale adoption and reach(DigiLocker, MyGov), and the vaccine journey through Co-Win are important and successfulmilestones in India’s public digital infrastructure journey.14 As per https://openforge.gov.in/ , last accessed 4 January 2023.15 https://bhashini.gov.in Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 369Box Xii.6: unified Payments interface - the game changer in real-timepayments!‘I like how you’ve brought out the rising popularity of UPI. I laud my fellow Indians forembracing digital payments! They’ve shown remarkable adaptability to tech and innovation’shri narendra Modi, hon’ble PMUnified Payments Interface (UPI) is a system that empowers and knits multiple bank accountsinto a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features,seamless fund routing and merchant payments into one hood. It also caters to the “Peer to Peer”collection request, which can be scheduled and paid as per requirement and convenience.Introduced in 2016 to revolutionize the payment landscape through universal operability,single payment address, and low-cost mobile-first payment system, UPI has acted as a positivedisruption towards enabling greater digital payments adoption in the country. UPI is a singlemobile application for accessing different bank accounts. It can be accessed on all majorplatforms, such as Android and iOS. As the application is user-friendly and fast, consumersand merchants have displayed a great affinity to digital technology, leading to rapid growth inthis digital payment infrastructure. The journey of UPI has been fascinating. The number ofbanks that became part of the real-time payment system increased from 35 in December 2017to more than 380 in December 2022. Though pre-existing payment modes such as debit cards,credit cards, National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement(RTGS) have grown over time, UPI has shown a quantum jump comparatively to become oneof the preferred modes of payment. In this sense, the progress of UPI has been remarkable.In FY19, UPI accounted for 17 per cent of the country's total 3,100 crore digital transactions.The next fiscal year saw UPI’s share rise to more than 27 per cent as it processed 1,250 croretransactions out of 4,600 crore digital transactions. In FY22, UPI accounted for 52 per cent ofthe total 8,840 crore financial digital transactions.On average, between FY19-22 (calendar year), growth in UPI-based transactions in value andvolume terms have been 121 per cent and 115 per cent, respectively. Recently, in Dec 2022,UPI touched its highest-ever mark with 782 crore transactions worth ₹12.8 lakh crore.140 8,000126120 7,0006,0001005,00080 724,000603,00040 342,0001820 1,000610 02017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022erorchkaL₹erorcUPI transactions over the calendar yearsValue(₹ Lakh crore) Volume (RHS)Source: NPCI 370 Economic Survey 2022-23UPI also allows for multiple methods for integrating payments—QR based payments beingthe most popular. In just 5 years, over 23 crore UPI QRs have been deployed in the marketfor accepting merchant payments, from only 25 lakhs devices that were accepting merchantpayments before this.The benefits of UPI became evident during the Covid-19 pandemic when UPI served as acritical lifeline, especially for small and micro merchants. Further, UPI has processed 2,922crore contactless merchants’ transactions with a total value over ₹21.7 lakh crore in FY23 (tillDecember 2022).The success of UPI has not been restricted to India alone; NPCI, through its internationalarm NPCIL is pushing for acceptance of RuPay/UPI powered apps, cross-border remittanceand UPI-Like deployment in international markets such as Singapore, UAE, France, theNetherlands among others.Initiative towards the discussion on cross-border remittances will help reduce the cost incurredand procedures involved towards money transfer at present by the migrant workers. Thesmooth transfer of money will increase the total value of remittances, increasing their impacton economic development. NPCI has also succeeded in developing an exemplary robustpayments system that is cost-effective, secure, convenient and instantaneous. Several nationshave displayed an inclination towards establishing a ‘real-time payment system’ or ‘domesticcard scheme’ inspired by the exemplary innovations by NPCI in the country.Tech companies are increasingly leveraging the power of UPI to expand the digital ecosystem,which has led to a significant acceleration in the pace of financial inclusion. UPI has opened upmany opportunities for start-ups and e-Commerce players to develop innovative solutions thatelevate the customer experience. The open systems have enabled global players like Google,WhatsApp, Walmart, True Caller, Amazon, Uber etc., to provide UPI services.It is envisioned that the journey of UPI will help accelerate the process of financial inclusionand digital adoption in India by creating a more prosperous and inclusive ecosystem that canaccommodate larger sections of the population in times to come.12.78 The introduction of GST, with its end-to-end digitisation of all processes, digitalisationof tax administration, and the faceless e–assessment scheme for Income Tax, have improvedgovernance and formalisation of the economy. The seamless generations of e-way bills andelectronic toll collections have further augmented better tax collections for the government.It has not just helped in curbing tax evasion but generated trust for small businesses throughmonitoring compliance.12.79 The government has also taken initiatives towards empowering individuals with controlover their data to access essential services related to finance, health, education, and skills digitally.The Account Aggregator (AA) is a global techno-legal framework that enables individuals toshare their financial data quickly and securely, with their consent, with any regulated third-partyfinancial institution of their choice. The AA framework is currently live across over 110 crore ofbank accounts. Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth 37112.80 Adding to the journey, FY15 can be considered a turning point for the Indian start-upenvironment. The reforms led by our government, in addition to existing inherent advantageslike demography, technological developments, entrepreneurial spirit, and market size, havechanged the landscape of the start-up ecosystem in India. The year 2021 marked the completionof five years of the ‘Stand-up India’ scheme (launched in January 2016), and the numbers - withmore than 84,000 recognized start-ups - tell the entire story. Start-ups have moved past thetraditional territory of consumer products and services to much larger value-added services suchas satellites.12.81 India is also geared to strengthen the up-and-coming drone industry. Under Mission'Drone Shakti', the drone start-ups and Drone-as-a-Service (DrAAS) are being promoted. Almost90 per cent of the airspace has now been opened up as a green zone for flying drones up to 400feet. A Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for drones and drone import policy havebeen notified. Also, the private equity investments in agri-tech space have skyrocketed overthe past four years – witnessing an increase of more than 50 per cent per annum to aggregateapproximately ₹6600 crore.12.82 As our digital space widens to bring in newer services, the need for appropriate regulationsalso becomes paramount. Therefore, techno-smart regulations are the future for digital societies.In this regard, the governments worldwide have adopted or are introducing legislation toprovide a foundation for robust data governance. Their policy goals can be complemented andadvanced with the help of standard, open, and interoperable protocols that increase the choiceof digital services available to a user and enhance user privacy, such as the Data Empowerment& Protection Architecture.conclusion/outlook12.83 Today, we are operating in the new normal where the global economy is still recoveringfrom the setback due to pandemic, and geo-political conflicts persist. India could effectivelysteer through the situation owing to its dedicated support to infrastructure creation throughincreased capex and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. This underpinned economic growthwhen the private sector was cautious in investing due to its balance sheet problems and uncertaindemand outlook stemming from global shocks.12.84 The targeted increase in investment is seen across all infrastructure sectors. To helpsustain the investment drive, NIP provided a forward-looking roadmap of investible projects.Further, PM GatiShakti has helped accelerate infrastructure development by integrating the sevenengines (roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistic infrastructure)of growth. While traditional infrastructure sectors such as roads and railways have received arenewed push in recent years, sectors such as inland water transport and civil aviation, whichhave significant untapped potential, are also being encouraged sufficiently. Parallelly, the focusis also on improving coordination among different stakeholders and ministries. This will helpresolve compliance issues and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of investments.12.85 Besides, the reforms being undertaken in energy and power sector will help fast-trackIndia's progress in the next 25 years. With a population of nearly 140 crore, India has a massivedemand for energy from all sectors including primary, secondary and tertiary. Affordable and 372 Economic Survey 2022-23reliable availability of power is critical for India’s aspirations for the manufacturing sector tobe fulfilled. Further, with the growing importance of clean energy, there has been a renewedpush towards non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in the power sector. The government, alongwith the private sector, has progressively worked towards increasing the share of renewables.This will ensure a gradual but calibrated energy transition, meeting the country’s sustainabilitytargets and giving primacy to its national developmental requirements.12.86 With the advent of new technologies, we are witnessing new regulatory challenges.Technology and innovation are, per se, neither constructive nor destructive. The use casespresent the positive aspects of technology and innovation. The government is committed tokeeping pace with the digital landscape developments including those related to legislations andframeworks. While the digital journey started with Aadhaar as a medium for service delivery atthe doorstep, UPI strengthened the digital payment infrastructure. With other initiatives like Co-WIN, e-RUPI, TReDS, Account Aggregators, ONDC, etc. at different stages of implementation,India has developed a unique and cogent digital story to tell. The journey is ongoing and thereis much untapped potential in India's digital public infrastructure space.12.87 In sum, the synergy between physical and digital infrastructure will be one of the definingfeatures of India's future growth story.
